The tragedy is that my story could have been his.Two kids named Wes Moore were born blocks apart within a year of each other. Both grew up fatherless in similar Baltimore neighborhoods and had difficult childhoods; both hung out on street corners with their crews; both ran into trouble with the police. How, then, did one grow up to be a Rhodes Scholar, decorated veteran, White House Fellow, and business leader, while the other ended up a convicted murderer serving a life sentence? Wes Moore, the author of this fascinating book, sets out to answer this profound question. In alternating narratives that take readers from heart-wrenching losses to moments of surprising redemption, The Other Wes Moore tells the story of a generation of boys trying to find their way in a hostile world.},

	abstract = {Climate change policy has commonly been framed as a matter of international governance for which global policy strategies can be readily employed. The decade of experience following the 1997 signing of the Kyoto Protocol suggests a far more complex process involving a wide range of policy options and varied engagement by multiple levels of governance systems. The respective experiences of the United States and Canada suggest that formal engagement in the international realm of policy is not a good indicator of domestic policy development or emissions reductions. The different contexts of intergovernmental relations, varied resources available to subnational governments for policy development and implementation, and role of subnational leaders in policy formation have emerged as important factors in explaining national differences between these North American neighbors. Consequently, climate change increasingly presents itself as a challenge not only of international relations but also of multilevel governance, thereby creating considerable opportunity to learn from domestic policy experimentation.},

	abstract = {This article reviews and assesses the outcome of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Paris in December 2015. It argues that the Paris Agreement breaks new ground in international climate policy, by acknowledging the primacy of domestic politics in climate change and allowing countries to set their own level of ambition for climate change mitigation. It creates a framework for making voluntary pledges that can be compared and reviewed internationally, in the hope that global ambition can be increased through a process of 'naming and shaming'. By sidestepping distributional conflicts, the Paris Agreement manages to remove one of the biggest barriers to international climate cooperation. It recognizes that none of the major powers can be forced into drastic emissions cuts. However, instead of leaving mitigation efforts to an entirely bottom-up logic, it embeds country pledges in an international system of climate accountability and a 'ratchet mechanism', thus offering the chance of more durable international cooperation. At the same time, it is far from clear whether the treaty can actually deliver on the urgent need to de-carbonize the global economy. The past record of climate policies suggests that governments have a tendency to express lofty aspirations but avoid tough decisions. For the Paris Agreement to make a difference, the new logic of 'pledge and review' will need to mobilize international and domestic pressure and generate political momentum behind more substantial climate policies worldwide. It matters, therefore, whether the Paris Agreement's new approach can be made to work.},

These policies have ignored the true nature of the climate change mitigation problem and have failed. This Note proposes a new design for a climate change mitigation system. It begins by analyzing the basic assumptions of the current cursory approach and by reviewing structural problems with those assumptions. It then reviews the successful World Trade Organization (WTO) model as a possible alternative structure and uses realities of the climate change problem to show why such an alternative could work in the climate change context. This analysis suggests that three structural changes to the current climate change mitigation system would significantly improve the current approach. First, the system should allow for incremental mitigation. Second, the system should contain separate categories of agreements for energy decarbonization, efficiency and conservation, and natural sinks. Finally, the system should allow for the separate negotiation of certain issues within each category: basic principles, maximum achievable emissions reductions of each mitigation method, and "hog-trading" burden allocation. This Note calls for the creation of the World Climate Change Organization (WCCO) to facilitate and administer this collection of agreements.},

Given their capacity to foster the spread of climate policy innovations among cities, TMNs can thus be expected to play a decisive role in a climate governance system that is becoming increasingly fragmented, polycentric, and transnational.},

Because there are few international mechanisms to address violations of human rights law (Neumayer 2005), actors like IOs and NGOs engage in naming and shaming campaigns with the hope that negative publicity pressures repressive regimes to better respect human rights. A great deal of resources support these international advocacy campaigns. Between April 2009 and March 2010, Amnesty International (AI) spent \$ 21,451,000—about 98 percent of its expended resources—on activities in furtherance of the group’s objectives, including research into rights violations and advocacy campaigns publicizing the results of that research (AI 2010, 8, 13). 1 And in its 2010–2011 spending plan, the United Nations (UN) earmarked \$24,520,400—5.9 percent of its operating budget—for human rights and humanitarian affairs (United Nations 2010, 2). 2 Clearly, international advocacy organizations invest resources in the naming and shaming of human rights violations like torture.

In contrast, autocracies, which lack these domestic sources of information on abuses, are more sensitive to international shaming. Using data on naming and shaming taken from Western press reports and Amnesty International, the authors demonstrate that naming and shaming is associated with improved human rights outcomes in autocracies, but with either no effect or a worsening of outcomes in democracies and hybrid regimes.},

I test whether naming and shaming by NGOs, the media, and IOs significantly reduces the severity of the killing. Ordered logit analyses of ongoing genocides and politicides from 1976 to 2008 reveal that naming and shaming by Amnesty International, the Northern media, and the UNCHR have significant ameliorative effects on the severity of the most extreme atrocities.

	abstract = {The impact of armed conflict on children has been recognized for some time as a major humanitarian problem. In 1999, the United Nations (UN) Security Council began taking up the abuse of children during armed conflict as a regular thematic issue. As part of the protective framework, the UN adopted a “strategy” of “naming and shaming” government forces and rebel groups recruiting, killing, maiming, raping or other sexual abusing of children during conflict. The philosophical justification of the public exposures is premised on the supposed stigmatic and deterrent effect on named and shamed offenders. However, little analysis has gone into the impact of this UN policy. This paper has the modest aim of assessing the UN’s naming and shaming practice since inception of the policy in 2002. The efficacy of shaming sanctions is contestable. The recent UN annual statistics on the exposed parties do not seem to evince a convincing causal link between of naming and shaming and adherence to international humanitarian law and international human rights law, particularly among armed non-State groups (ANSAs) so far. Naming and shaming represents an antagonistic modus operandi. This paper argues that humanitarian engagement with ANSAs offers a non-confrontational and corrective approach and thus greater promise for compliance and protection of children during armed conflict than naming and shaming.},

* 2The three components could not be separated by gel-filtration, suggesting that the enzyme was homogeneous with respect to molecular weight. A molecular weight of 55000 was obtained for all the three isoenzymes, as determined by gel-filtration on Sephadex G-100 and Sephadex G-200.
* 3The isoenzymic nature of the three forms was suggested by differences in their pH optima, Michaelis constants, response to activation and inhibition, substrate specificities and electrophoretic mobilities.
* 4The isolation procedure was readily adapted to the preparation of large quantities of the isoenzymes. These partially-purified forms were electrophoretically indistinguishable from the three components which could be demonstrated in the original wheat-germ extract.},

	abstract = {The broad substrate specificity of a homogeneous isoenzyme of wheat germ acid phosphatase (WGAP) was extensively investigated by chromatographic, electrophoretic, NMR, and kinetic procedures. WGAP exhibited no divalent metal ion requirement and was unaffected upon incubation with EDTA or o-phenanthroline. A comparison of two catalytically homogeneous isoenzymes revealed little difference in substrate specificity. The specificity of WGAP was established by determining the Michaelis constants for a wide variety of substrates, p-Nitrophenyl phosphate, pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, and ATP were preferred substrates while lesser activities were seen toward sugar phosphates, trimetaphosphate, phosphoproteins, and (much less) phosphodiesters. An extensive table of Km and Vmax values is given. The pathway for the hydrolysis of trimetaphosphate was examined by colorimetric and 31P NMR methods and it was found that linear tripolyphosphate is not a free intermediate in the enzymatic reaction. In contrast to literature reports, homogeneous wheat germ acid phosphatase exhibits no measureable carboxylesterase activity, nor does it hydrolyze phenyl phosphonothioate esters or phytic acid at significant rates.},

	abstract = {GM crops have been formed by altering the genetic makeup of traditional crop varieties. High profit margin, easy maintenance, potential to resist environmental changes has fascinated farmers to adapt these crops. In India more than 14 different research centers have been committed for the development of different GMO plants with Bt-Cotton, Bt-Brinjal being introduced in Indian markets.
Methods either based upon vector or direct (vector less) gene transfer has been used as a gene delivery system to produce transformed plant varieties. Suitable selectable marker genes are used to specifically identify the recombinants from the non recombinant ones.
The ever increase population size, development of resistant varieties, shrinking of fertile land and water resources have hampered food supply globally. GM crops could be looked upon as an important alternative in providing food security, simultaneously economically strengthening our farmers and reducing their dependency on nature (rainfall, etc). GM crops have also been used as a source of oil, sugar, paper, biofuel, etc.
Researchers indicated the risk of genetic transformation through GM crops into the native varieties. These genes could provide a selective advantage to organisms and could give rise to pandemic diseases. Moreover novel proteins could provoke allergic response, auto immune disorders or could be toxic to infants, elderly population.
The criticism to GM crops can only be coped up with stringent testing under greenhouses with different environmental conditions (biotic \& abiotic variations) to check out the least possibility of gene transformations. Scientists must limit the transfer of foreign genes into pollen grains and chloroplast as well as develop minimal cassette systems. Centralized testing facilities should be developed across the globe and unbiased results should be published ensuring safety and security of our future generations.},

More than 75\% of the chemicals could affect the skin, eyes, and other sensory organs, and the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Approximately 40–50\% could affect the brain/nervous system, immune and cardiovascular systems, and the kidneys; 37\% could affect the endocrine system; and 25\% could cause cancer and mutations. These results indicate that many chemicals used during the fracturing and drilling stages of gas operations may have long-term health effects that are not immediately expressed. In addition, an example was provided of waste evaporation pit residuals that contained numerous chemicals on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) lists of hazardous substances. The discussion highlights the difficulty of developing effective water quality monitoring programs.

	abstract = {Since the 9/11 incident, global political and security landscape have drastically changed. Terrorism and counter-terrorism have inevitably become significant global agendas. For Thailand, threats of terrorism have just recently manifested, that is, the bombing incident in Sukhumvit 71 on 14 February 2012 by five Iranians. The incident was a very hot topic in Thai society at the time.However, looking at historical facts, it would be found that Thailand had been the location of terrorist incidents arising from foreign organisations or groups of individuals for at least 10 times since 1972. Hence, this article has been written with an urge to answer two major questions regarding the incidents: 1) situational question; what were the causes of the terrorism incidents in Thailand, how was the overall pattern of each incident, and how likely it would be for another incident to occur in the future and why?; and 2) question on policies and strategy; how were Thailand’s public sector’s previous policies, strategies and actions to manage the threats from transnational terrorism, especially those of security agencies, were there any problems and obstacles, and what would be the public sector’s plans for the time ahead? In this article, the researcher has employed documentary analysis, in-depth interviewing, and organisation of focus-group conferences under the conceptual frameworks on international terrorism in globalisation era and national advantages, with expectations that answering the aforementioned questioned would meaningfully help in predicting the trends and risks of Thailand to become a place of incident in the future, as well as providing an analysis on potential solutions and approaches to control such threats in a more efficient manner.},

	abstract = {A series of bombings tore through seven Thai provinces popular with foreign tourists on August 11 and 12, 2016. The attack killed four Thai nationals and wounded more than 30 others, including citizens from Austria, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. No group claimed responsibility, though Thai authorities said the attacks followed “a similar pattern used in the southern parts of the country,” referring to the ongoing separatist insurgency in Thailand’s predominantly-Muslim south. Later in August, Thai police said that at least 20 people—most of them Muslim insurgents from the country’s south—were believed to be behind the bombings. Similar bomb attacks have continued into 2017. (Sources: TIME, Financial Times, Bangkok Post, Reuters) The August attacks came days after Thai citizens voted in favor of a constitution that gave more powers to the ruling military junta. The junta—which took over in a May 2014 coup—initially ruled out the possibility of peace talks with the separatist rebels. However, negotiations between the junta and Mara Patani, an organization representing the insurgents, began in early September 2016. The Malaysian government is facilitating the talks.

	abstract = {Download the Report John Blaxland and Greg Raymond’s study breaks new ground in our understanding of Thai strategic and military culture and how Thai security elites view the United States, China, and the shifting geopolitical landscape in Asia. This analysis provides a roadmap to scholars seeking to understand shifting Thai policies and for policymakers seeking to maintain a strong footing for the U.S.-Thailand alliance during a time of strategic flux. For centuries Thailand has been a master in the pursuit of strategic independence and balancing relations with great powers to avoid foreign domination. This tradition remains a powerful influence in Thai strategic culture, and it is thus perhaps unsurprising that Thai leaders have sought closer military and strategic ties with China. And yet at the same time, this preference for a balanced and independent foreign policy means that Thailand will not rush headlong into an embrace of China as a primary security partner. Rather, Thai security elites will seek to maintain the advantages brought by having a close security relationship with the United States. A particularly valuable contribution of this Centre of Gravity study is what it reveals about the strategic advantages the United States continues to enjoy as a security partner to Thailand. The long, close relationship between the two militaries has created a large reserve of assets, relationships and positive experiences which are not easily replaced. These advantages include English language proficiency, adoption of U.S. military doctrine, and the volume and sophistication of joint military-to-military training and exercises. This report is well timed, given the ongoing reassessment in Washington about the U.S.-Thailand alliance in the wake of the 2014 military coup. Unlike the previous coup in 2006, the 2014 coup was accompanied by harsh restrictions on civil liberties including freedom of speech and assembly, and it quickly became clear that a return to civilian rule and elections would be slow, and perhaps not fully democratic. This led the Obama administration to take a harder line on Thailand’s military government than had been taken in response previous coups, including more vocal public criticism of the state of democracy and human rights in Thailand. Thai leaders deeply resented this treatment and relations began to cool considerably, with some noticeable effects on the alliance. Efforts were underway at the end of the Obama administration to recalibrate its approach towards Thailand and reengage in some key areas, and these efforts towards normalizing relations have accelerated considerably under the Trump administration as it seeks to “revitalize” the U.S.-Thailand alliance. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha met with President Trump at the White House in early October 2017, and was treated warmly as long-time friend and strategically important ally. The United States has a strong interest in seeing Thailand return to a full-fledged stable democracy, and it also has a strong interest in the region resuming a more a positive trajectory towards democracy, human rights and good governance. The United States needs to be both principled and pragmatic in balancing these interests. The analysis and policy recommendations offered here by John Blaxland and Gregory Raymond will be indispensable for those seeking to find the right balance through skillful statecraft.

	abstract = {The competition for existing freshwater supplies will require a paradigmatic shift from maximizing productivity per unit of land area to maximizing productivity per unit of water consumed. This shift will, in turn, demand broad systems approaches that physically and biologically optimize irrigation relative to water delivery and application schemes, rainfall, critical growth stages, soil fertility, location, and weather. Water can be conserved at a watershed or regional level for other uses only if evaporation, transpiration, or both are reduced and unrecoverable losses to unusable sinks are minimized (e.g., salty groundwater or oceans). Agricultural advances will include implementation of crop location strategies, conversion to crops with higher economic value or productivity per unit of water consumed, and adoption of alternate drought-tolerant crops. Emerging computerized GPS-based precision irrigation technologies for self-propelled sprinklers and microirrigation systems will enable growers to apply water and agrochemicals more precisely and site specifically to match soil and plant status and needs as provided by wireless sensor networks. Agriculturalists will need to exercise flexibility in managing the rate, frequency, and duration of water supplies to successfully allocate limited water and other inputs to crops. The most effective means to conserve water appears to be through carefully managed deficit irrigation strategies that are supported by advanced irrigation system and flexible, state-of-the-art water delivery systems. Nonagricultural water users will need to exercise patience as tools reflecting the paradigmatic shift are actualized. Both groups will need to cooperate and compromise as they practice more conservative approaches to freshwater consumption.},

	abstract = {The flood hazard in New York City depends on both storm surges and rising sea levels. We combine modeled storm surges with probabilistic sea-level rise projections to assess future coastal inundation in New York City from the preindustrial era through 2300 CE. The storm surges are derived from large sets of synthetic tropical cyclones, downscaled from RCP8.5 simulations from three CMIP5 models. The sea-level rise projections account for potential partial collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet in assessing future coastal inundation. CMIP5 models indicate that there will be minimal change in storm-surge heights from 2010 to 2100 or 2300, because the predicted strengthening of the strongest storms will be compensated by storm tracks moving offshore at the latitude of New York City. However, projected sea-level rise causes overall flood heights associated with tropical cyclones in New York City in coming centuries to increase greatly compared with preindustrial or modern flood heights. For the various sea-level rise scenarios we consider, the 1-in-500-y flood event increases from 3.4 m above mean tidal level during 1970–2005 to 4.0–5.1 m above mean tidal level by 2080–2100 and ranges from 5.0–15.4 m above mean tidal level by 2280–2300. Further, we find that the return period of a 2.25-m flood has decreased from ∼500 y before 1800 to ∼25 y during 1970–2005 and further decreases to ∼5 y by 2030–2045 in 95\% of our simulations. The 2.25-m flood height is permanently exceeded by 2280–2300 for scenarios that include Antarctica’s potential partial collapse.},

	abstract = {In the context of growing concern about the threat of flooding posed by climate change in coastal areas, the Spanish plan for coastal adaptation to climate change gave rise to stringent requirements on risk consequence estimates at the regional scale O (100 km). Within this framework, we propose a methodology that combines high space-time resolution climate information (reanalysis databases and projections), local data on exposure that accounts for the most relevant sectors, site-specific vulnerability functions, and flood risk consequence valuation, gridded at 5 m. This approach involves efficient multiple-forcing flood modeling, in which the connection between climate change and potential inundation is primarily established through the definition of a total water level index. This research tackles challenging issues, including the importance of incorporating the effects of existing coastal defenses and local wave effects in port areas, dealing with data at different spatial scales and sectors in an integrated way, and the impact of discounting. The results provide insights into the possible consequences of inaction for a range of future scenarios based on changes in climate and socio-economics over the most relevant sectors. With the goal of prioritizing adaptive action and the efficient assignment of funds, we propose a weight-based integration of the sectoral value-at-risk through the application of Bayesian techniques and expert judgment. The methodology described here was applied to a pilot case study on the coast of Asturias in northern Spain.},

This study evaluates the spatiotemporal variation of future drought (2016–2100) in the Pearl River Basin (PRB) using the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and future climate projections based on the general circulation models (GCMs) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) under three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. The results show that future drought conditions are expected to be more serious than historical (1960–2015) drought conditions in the PRB, especially under RCP8.5. The severity and variability of future drought conditions are also higher than for the historical period. The west Guangxi and South Guizhou provinces exhibit the highest increment in drought severity under the three RCP scenarios. At the seasonal scale, drought severity shows the highest increment in the winter with little change in summer; the summer drought severity increases in most areas of the PRB but the increment of the drought severity is lower than the winter. The number of future drought events is expected to decrease but the duration and severity are expected to increase, especially in the mid-west PRB and under high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios. In summary, in most areas of the PRB, the severity and variability of drought are expected to increase in the 21 st century, especially in the mid-west PRB and an increase in evapotranspiration is assumed to be the main underlying cause. Irrigation projects and agricultural production in the PRB might face serious threats of drought in the future.},

As the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) midlands rely heavily on agro-forestry and tourism to support the local economy, changes in fire dynamics need to be taken into consideration. This study aims to investigate fire dynamics under different climatic scenarios for the KZN midlands, South Africa. Using 25 years of meteorological data allows for the stochastic generation of long-term meteorological data. Six climatic scenarios, describing a warmer and wetter climate and a warmer and drier climate, are used to adjust the generated data. The Lowveld fire danger index is applied to the adjusted data and analysed. Results indicat that annual average fire danger in the KZN midlands is likely to increase significantly under all climate scenarios. Annual average fire danger under baseline conditions (no climate adjustment) averages at roughly 25. When adjusted for the worst case scenario, the annual average fire danger increases to an average of roughly 28-a statistically significant difference. Increased air temperatures are shown to influence fire danger significantly. The KZN midlands are likely to experience an increased frequency of high fire danger days. Changes in daily rainfall are shown to significantly influence the onset and length of the KZN midlands' fire season. Overall, the study indicates that the KZN midlands are likely to experience different fire dynamics under a changed climate, with significant implications for local landowners and local governments.},

In this paper, we introduce a new classification method based on the possibility measure, which does not require a precise belief model and, in a sense, it includes the Bayesian classifiers as special cases. This new classification method uses the fuzzy operators to aggregate attributes information (evidence) and it is referred to as fuzzy analysis of statistical evidence (FASE). FASE has several nice properties. It is noise tolerant, it can handle missing values with ease, and it can extract statistical patterns from the data and represent them by knowledge of beliefs, which, in turn, are propositions for an expert system. Thus, from pattern classification to expert systems, FASE provides a linkage from inductive reasoning to deductive reasoning},

	abstract = {Nearly all discussions about the appropriate consumption discount rate for climate-change policy evaluation assume that a single discount rate concept applies. We argue that two distinct concepts and associated rates apply. We distinguish a social-welfare-equivalent discount rate appropriate for determining whether a given policy would augment social welfare (according to a postulated social welfare function) and a finance-equivalent discount rate suitable for determining whether the policy would offer a potential Pareto improvement. Distinguishing the two rates helps resolve arguments as to whether the choice of discount rate should be based on ethical considerations or empirical information (such as market interest rates), and about whether the discount rate should serve a prescriptive or descriptive role. Separating out the two rates also helps clarify disputes about the appropriate stringency of climate change policy. We find that the structure of leading numerical optimization models used for climate policy analysis may have helped contribute to the blurring of the differences between the two rates. In addition, we indicate that uncertainty about underlying ethical parameters or market conditions implies that both rates should decline as the time-horizon increases.},

	abstract = {By Elias Ntungwe NgalameAKUM, Cameroon (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Farmers in this poverty-mired region of northwest Cameroon used to watch their vegetable patches dry up and die in drought periods, even though nearby rivers and streams offered a steady flow of water.The problem? Getting the water to the fields was nearly impossible because the area's steep, rocky terrain made carrying it hugely difficult.But now a channel irrigation system is allowing farmers to access water for their fields, helping them grow vegetables throughout the year and better manage worsening drought associated with climate change."We are really grateful to God for providing us the streams through which we are tapping water to grow our crops. Even in the absence of rain we are now sure of food on our tables and income to send our kids to school,” said Akwi Rachel, a member of the Akum Vegetable Farmers Group, one organization benefiting from the irrigation scheme.The system uses a network of farmer-built canals that rely on gravity to bring stream water to fields in Cameroon’s Akum and Santa districts.The two districts sit in a semi-arid area of the country, but streams from the lush highlands flow through it, making irrigation a good option.Before, “we could not grow our vegetables and other crops during the prolonged dry periods because of lack of water. We have been suffering even though we are blessed with nearby streams,” said Jude Awantung, a farmer in Santa.But now "we now have good yields even in the prolonged dry periods", she said.MORE VEGETABLES, MORE INCOMEFarmers built the canals starting in 2013 with financial help from Cameroon’s government, backed by a \$25 million loan from the African Development Bank.Some farmers also built small water storage tanks to capture water when plenty is available and save it for very dry periods.The project is part of an effort to provide climate change adaptation assistance in drought-hit areas, said Benjamin Fobuzo, who is in charge of project execution for government rural development efforts in North West Cameroon.The irrigation project has raised annual vegetable production in the two districts by about 37,000 tonnes since 2013, and boosted farmer income from an average of about \$425 a year in 2013 to about \$615 this year, according to Gregory Muluh Ngu, the head of government rural development programs in the North West region."We are happy the irrigation program is improving agricultural production and incomes,” Muluh said.The building, monitoring and maintenance of the irrigation system – including channels, water catchments and small dams in a few areas – is carried out by farmers.The systems serve around 139,000 farmers and 84,600 agricultural laborers, who use it to grow vegetables such as tomato, cucumber, lettuce and okra, Muluh said.With rain-fed agriculture becoming increasingly unreliable, farmers need help to keep up harvests, agricultural experts in the region say."Supporting irrigation has become crucial in drought-hit regions in the North West,” said Godfrey Nutoto, the regional head of the Ministry of Agriculture in North West Cameroon.He said that replicating the project in other areas of the country that also suffer from drought could “significantly boost food production in the country”.FEEDING MARKETSWith access to irrigation, farmers in Akum and Santa – many of them women – can produce five vegetable harvests a year, including during the dry season, when demand and prices are highest, Nutoto said. Many of the vegetables end up in markets throughout the country, he said.More than half of the 1.95 million people in Cameroon's North West region live in poverty, and the region is home to 13 percent of the country’s rural poor, according to government statistics.The irrigation project has helped cut shortages of vegetables, particularly during the dry season, and helped boost the planting success of farmers during that period from less than 10 percent to over 90 percent, Nutoto said.Growing maize and a range of vegetables is now an all-year-round business for farmers in the area, which means improved incomes and better living conditions, he said.On average, small-scale farmers in the irrigated area cultivate tiny plots of about 200 square meters.The irrigation development program aims not only to help farmers but boost supplies of food in Cameroon’s cities during the dry season."I now produce enough tomatoes for our local markets and to supply to bigger markets in Douala and Yaounde even in the dry season,” said Awangtung, a farmer in Santa.Pressure on food resources in Cameroon is climbing, especially in the drought-stricken Northern and East regions.A July UNICEF report said Cameroon also faces food shortages in its northern regions because of an influx of refugees fleeing conflict with Islamist group Boko Haram.More than 65,000 refugees from Nigeria and about 260,000 from the Central African Republic are now living in Cameroon’s resource-short East and Adamawa regions, the report said.This year, about 61,000 children under 5 in Cameroon are expected to suffer from life-threatening malnutrition as a result of this ongoing crisis, the report said.

	abstract = {By Chris ArsenaultMENAKA, Mali (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Life has never been easy in Moussa Majga's corner of northern Mali, a desert region of leafless trees, mud huts and roaming gunmen.For years, violence has plagued Majga's dusty town, the scene of clashes between government forces and Tuareg-led separatists who took advantage of a 2012 coup in Mali's capital Bamako to escalate their uprising.But today, the biggest security concern for the ageing chieftain is a new cycle of ferocious droughts he blames on climate change, that is savaging his people."There is a crisis due to the lack of rain," says Majga, sporting a white robe and thick, knock-off designer watch, during a community meeting in the town now controlled by the rebel Movement for the National Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). A dozen local residents nod in agreement. Mali's average rainfall has dropped by 30 percent since 1998 with droughts becoming longer and more frequent, according to a 2013 study by the U.S. army's Strategic Studies Institute.As a consequence, hunger is a chronic problem in the West African country with more than 1.8 million people, including 660,000 children, in need of food aid. But the situation is worse in the north, which was briefly seized in 2012 by Tuareg separatists allied with Islamic militants until a French-led military operation scattered them.Here, some 270,000 people face starvation, according to figures from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).EXPANDING DESERTFor generations, people from Menaka have wandered the land with their cows and goats in search of water and grass for grazing. Now, even this is under threat, Majga said. The Sahara desert is expanding southward at a rate of 48 kms a year, forcing whole communities to migrate and pushing them on to land occupied by other groups, researchers said in a 2011 study.Herders from other regions, and even neighboring countries such as Algeria and Niger, are moving onto territory that Majga's mostly Tuareg community uses for grazing. "This will destroy the land even more," he said, fearing inter-communal conflicts.Experts have long warned of the risk that climate change would worsen conflict in many of the world's poorest regions as different groups struggling to cope with poor rains and growing desertification take up arms to fight over scarce resources.Last year, the Brookings Institute published a study showing that the frequency of cross-border violence grows by four percent, while inter group violence - the kind seen in Mali - rises 14 percent for each percentage change in average temperature and rainfall.WARNING SIGNSPittsburg State University professor Steve Harmon said water shortages linked to global warming is one of the factors fuelling the latest Tuareg revolt in a country that has had four rebellions since winning independence from France in 1960.  "The droughts of the 1970s and 1980s in the Sahel were kind of the canary in the coal mine for climate change (causing violence)," Harmon said in an interview.The droughts decimated Tuareg animal herds, the main source of wealth and sustenance for the nomadic community. After losing their livelihoods as the climate became more erratic, many Tuareg fled to neighboring Libya, often serving in the security forces of ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi. Following Gaddafi's death in 2011, many Tuareg returned home and launched their latest uprising.     "The current crisis ... coincided with a period of drought and famine," Dona Stewart, a former U.S. military analyst, said in an interview. "Environmental issues certainly can exacerbate the economic and political drivers of conflict," she said, adding that it was impossible to draw a direct causal link between climate change and ongoing violence.  U.N.-brokered peace talks between Mali's government and the MNLA have stalled several times. A deal is expected to be signed on May 15 in Algeria, but violence is likely to continue even if that happens, since al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters and other armed groups operating in the north are not part of the negotiations, experts say.  FOOD IN EXCHANGE FOR JIHAD    The links between climate change, violence and basic human needs are not lost on Malian government officials."In the north there is such poverty, the environment is so tough, that when the jihadists come they find it easy to get followers," said Paul Coulibaly, a senior adviser to Mali's agriculture ministry, said in an interview in his air conditioned office in Bamako. "Even if they (fighters) don't bring money - just food - they will find allies if they can feed people," Coulibaly said. Chief Majga, however, does not believe the government really understands the problems his community face. Echoing one of the major grievances of the Tuareg separatists, he said the Bamako government had neglected the region and was responsible for its poverty."The government hasn't done anything," Majga said.Officials back in the capital said action was being taken to address some of the problems caused by climate change, pointing to new irrigation efforts and other plans to offset a warming planet. But officials also acknowledged that global warming was making it harder to produce food in Mali, and fuelling at least some of the strife the country currently faces. "The link between food security and political security is plainly obvious," Coulibaly said.   (Reporting by Chris Arsenault; Editing by Katie Nguyen)},

	abstract = {The devastating civil war that began in Syria in March 2011 is the result of complex interrelated factors. The focus of the conflict is regime change, but the triggers include a broad set of religious and sociopolitical factors, the erosion of the economic health of the country, a wave of political reform sweeping over the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Levant region, and challenges associated with climate variability and change and the availability and use of freshwater. As described here, water and climatic conditions have played a direct role in the deterioration of Syria’s economic conditions. There is a long history of conflicts over water in these regions because of the natural water scarcity, the early development of irrigated agriculture, and complex religious and ethnic diversity. In recent years, there has been an increase in incidences of water-related violence around the world at the subnational level attributable to the role that water plays in development disputes and economic activities. Because conflicts are rarely, if ever, attributable to single causes, conflict analysis and concomitant efforts at reducing the risks of conflict must consider a multitude of complex relationships and contributing factors. This paper assesses the complicated connections between water and conflict in Syria, looks more broadly at future climate-related risks for water systems, and offers some water management strategies for reducing those risks.},

	abstract = {It is the aim of these lectures to introduce some basic zeta functions and their uses in the areas of the Casimir effect and Bose-Einstein condensation. A brief introduction into these areas is given in the respective sections. We will consider exclusively spectral zeta functions, that is zeta functions arising from the eigenvalue spectrum of suitable differential operators. There is a set of technical tools that are at the very heart of understanding analytical properties of essentially every spectral zeta function. Those tools are introduced using the well-studied examples of the Hurwitz, Epstein and Barnes zeta function. It is explained how these different examples of zeta functions can all be thought of as being generated by the same mechanism, namely they all result from eigenvalues of suitable (partial) differential operators. It is this relation with partial differential operators that provides the motivation for analyzing the zeta functions considered in these lectures. Motivations come for example from the questions "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" and "What does the Casimir effect know about a boundary?". Finally "What does a Bose gas know about its container?"},

Current trajectories indicate the viability of deploying large-scale shared e-bike (e-bikeshare) systems in China. We employ a stated preference survey and multinomial logit to model the factors influencing the choice to switch from an existing transportation mode to bikeshare or e-bikeshare in Beijing. Demand is influenced by distinct sets of factors: the bikeshare choice is most sensitive to measures of effort and comfort while the e-bikeshare choice is more sensitive to user heterogeneities. Bikeshare demand is strongly negatively impacted by trip distance, temperature, precipitation, and poor air quality. User demographics however do not factor strongly on the bikeshare choice, indicating the mode will draw users from across the social spectrum. The e-bikeshare choice is much more tolerant of trip distance, high temperatures and poor air quality, though precipitation is also a highly negative factor. User demographics do play a significant role in e-bikeshare demand. Analysis of impact to the existing transportation system finds that both bikeshare and e-bikeshare will tend to draw users away from the “unsheltered modes”, walk, bike, and e-bike. Although it is unclear if shared bikes are an attractive “first-and-last-mile solution”, it is clear that e-bikeshare is attractive as a bus replacement.},

	abstract = {The growing number of bike sharing systems (BSS) in many cities largely facilitates biking for transportation and recreation. Most recent bike sharing systems produce time and location specific data, which enables the study of travel behavior and mobility of each individual. However, despite a rapid growth of interest, studies on massive bike sharing data and the underneath travel pattern are still limited. Few studies have explored and visualized spatiotemporal patterns of bike sharing behavior using flow clustering, nor examined the station functional profiles based on over-demand patterns. This study investigated the spatiotemporal biking pattern in Chicago by analyzing massive BSS data from July to December in 2013 and 2014. The BSS in Chicago gained more popularity. About 15.9\% more people subscribed to this service. Specifically, we constructed bike flow similarity graph and used fastgreedy algorithm to detect spatial communities of biking flows. By using the proposed methods, we discovered unique travel patterns on weekdays and weekends as well as different travel trends for customers and subscribers from the noisy massive amount data. In addition, we also examined the temporal demands for bikes and docks using hierarchical clustering method. Results demonstrated the modeled over-demand patterns in Chicago. This study contributes to offer better knowledge of biking flow patterns, which was difficult to obtain using traditional methods. Given the trend of increasing popularity of the BSS and data openness in different cities, methods used in this study can extend to examine the biking patterns and BSS functionality in different cities.},

	abstract = {Bike-sharing systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in urban environments. They provide a low-cost, environmentally-friendly transportation alternative for cities. The management of these systems gives rise to many optimization problems. Chief among these problems is the issue of bicycle rebalancing. Users imbalance the system by creating demand in an asymmetric pattern. This necessitates action to put the system back in balance with the requisite levels of bicycles at each station to facilitate future use. In this paper, we tackle the problem of maintaing system balance during peak rush-hour usage as well as rebalancing overnight to prepare the system for rush-hour usage. We provide novel problem formulations that have been motivated by both a close collaboration with the New York City bike share (Citibike) and a careful analysis of system usage data. We analyze system data to discover the best placement of bikes to facilitate usage. We solve routing problems for overnight shifts as well as clustering problems for handling mid rush-hour usage. The tools developed from this research are currently in daily use at NYC Bike Share LLC, operators of Citibike.},

We provide a spatiotemporal analysis of 13 weeks of bicycle station usage from Barcelona's shared bicycling system, called Bicing. We apply clustering techniques to identify shared behaviors across stations and show how these behaviors relate to location, neighborhood, and time of day. We then compare experimental results from four predictive models of near-term station usage. Finally, we analyze the impact of factors such as time of day and station activity in the prediction capabilities of the algorithms.},

It addresses the role of domestic preferences and coalitions, domestic political institutions and practices, the strategies and tactics of negotiators, uncertainty, the domestic reverberation of international pressures, and the interests of the chief negotiator.

Section three describes Brazil's interests and negotiating positions with respect to three key issues: (a) emissions-reduction responsibilities; (b) protocol mechanisms; and (c) land-use change and forestry. The concluding section will then assess Brazil's contributions in terms of both achieving an accord that will slow global warming and promoting Brazilian national interests.},

These developments call attention to the state of our knowledge about change processes in governmental decisionmaking. This essay reviews the contributions of several areas of conceptual literature and proposes a scheme for interpreting decisions in which a government decides to change policy direction. Foreign policy changes can be placed on a continuum indicating the magnitude of the shift from minor adjustment changes, through both program and goal changes, to fundamental changes in a country's international orientation. These degrees of change are examined with respect to four change agents: (1) leader driven; (2) bureaucratic advocacy; (3) domestic restructuring; and (4) external shock. The phases of decisionmaking mediate between sources of change and the magnitude of change in policy. The essay concludes with an examination of propositions that suggest conditions under which the phases of decisionmaking can increase the likelihood of major change.},

After concluding that these contributions contain both promising ideas and analytical pitfalls, I present a model of my own, arguing that this constitutes a more promising route to the study of foreign policy change. In short, I argue that theoretical efforts in this field should focus on the simultaneous occurrence of changes in fundamental structural conditions, strategic political leadership, and the presence of a crisis of some kind. Though the existing models pay attention to some of these elements, none is designed to include all three.},

Motivated by a combination of international prestige and survival strategies, the country has sought to position itself as a neutral peacemaker in many of the international and intra-national conflicts brewing across the Middle East region. In three of the most notable cases in which it has involved itself — Lebanon, Sudan, and Yemen — Qatar has proven itself to be a capable mediator in reducing tensions but not, crucially, in resolving conflicts. Qatar's successes have been facilitated by a combination of its perceived neutrality by the disputants, the vast financial resources at its disposal to host mediation talks and off er financial incentives for peace, and the personal commitment and involvement of the state's top leaders. These successes, however, are often checked by limited capabilities to affect long-term changes to the preferences of the disputants through power projection abilities, in-depth administrative and on-the-ground resources, and apparent underestimations of the complexities of the deep-rooted conflicts at hand. Qatarí mediation efforts are likely to continue in the foreseeable future, but their outcomes are also likely to remain mixed.},

In this review we will discuss how regulatory T cells (Tregs) came to be recognized as an attractive way to promote transplantation tolerance. We will summarize the preclinical data, supporting the importance of these cells in the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance and that provide the rationale for the isolation and expansion of these cells for cellular therapy. We will also describe the data from the first clinical trials, using Tregs to inhibit graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and will address both the challenges and opportunities in human Treg cell therapy.},

In experimental transplantation models in which tolerance was induced, donor-specific Treg cells could be identified that were capable of transferring the tolerant state to naive animals. Furthermore, these cells appeared to have indirect allospecificity for donor antigens. Here we show that in vivo alloresponses can be regulated by donor alloantigen-specific Treg cells selected and expanded in vitro. Using autologous dendritic cells pulsed with an allopeptide from H2-Kb, we generated and expanded T-cell lines from purified Treg cells of CBA mice (H2k). Compared with fresh Treg cells, the cell lines maintained their characteristic phenotype, suppressive function, and homing capacities in vivo. When cotransferred with naive CD4+CD25- effector T cells after thymectomy and T-cell depletion in CBA mice that received CBK (H2k+Kb) skin grafts, the expanded Treg cells preferentially accumulated in the graft-draining lymph nodes and within the graft while preventing CBK but not third-party B10.A (H2k+Dd) skin graft rejection. In wild-type CBA, these donor-specific Treg cells significantly delayed CBK skin graft rejection without any other immunosuppression. Taken together, these data suggest that in vitro-generated tailored Treg cells could be considered a therapeutic tool to promote donor-specific transplant tolerance.},

Here, we show that the few CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells naturally present in the transplant regulate GVHD because their removal from the graft dramatically accelerates this disease. Furthermore, the addition of freshly isolated CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells at time of grafting significantly delays or even prevents GVHD. Ex vivo-expanded CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells obtained after stimulation by allogeneic recipient-type antigen-presenting cells can also modulate GVHD.

	abstract = {A mathematical model of the early inflammatory response in transplantation is formulated with ordinary differential equations. We first consider the inflammatory events associated only with the initial surgical procedure and the subsequent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) events that cause tissue damage to the host as well as the donor graft. These events release damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), thereby initiating an acute inflammatory response. In simulations of this model, resolution of inflammation depends on the severity of the tissue damage caused by these events and the patient’s (co)-morbidities. We augment a portion of a previously published mathematical model of acute inflammation with the inflammatory effects of T cells in the absence of antigenic allograft mismatch (but with DAMP release proportional to the degree of graft damage prior to transplant). Finally, we include the antigenic mismatch of the graft, which leads to the stimulation of potent memory T cell responses, leading to further DAMP release from the graft and concomitant increase in allograft damage. Regulatory mechanisms are also included at the final stage. Our simulations suggest that surgical injury and I/R-induced graft damage can be well-tolerated by the recipient when each is present alone, but that their combination (along with antigenic mismatch) may lead to acute rejection, as seen clinically in a subset of patients. An emergent phenomenon from our simulations is that low-level DAMP release can tolerize the recipient to a mismatched allograft, whereas different restimulation regimens resulted in an exaggerated rejection response, in agreement with published studies. We suggest that mechanistic mathematical models might serve as an adjunct for patient- or sub-group-specific predictions, simulated clinical studies, and rational design of immunosuppression.},

	issn = {0022-5193},
	abstract = {Regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells play a major role in natural tolerance to body components and therefore are relevant to understand the self-non-self discrimination by the immune system. The most pressing theoretical question, regarding the fact that these regulatory cells perform their function through linked recognition of the APCs, is how this "non-specific" mechanism permits a proper balance between tolerance and immunity that is compatible with an effective self-non-self discrimination. To tackle this issue, we develop a numerical simulation, which extends a previous mathematical model of T-cell-mediated suppression to include the thymic generation and the peripheral dynamics of many T cell clones. This simulation can mimic the capacity of the immune system to establish natural tolerance to self-antigens and reliably mount immune responses to foreign antigens. Natural tolerance is based on ubiquitous and constitutive self-antigens, which select and sustain clones of specific regulatory cells. Immune responses to foreign antigens are only achieved if they displace the self-antigens from the APCs, leading to a loss of the regulatory cells, and/or if the foreign antigen introduction entails a sharp increase in the total number of APCs. Meaningful behavior is obtained even if differentiation of regulatory cells in the thymus is antigen non-specific, but requires that a minimum number of new T cells enter the periphery per unit of time, and that the repertoire is selected so that anti-self-affinities are within a proper interval. We conclude that positive selection is required to generate a sufficiently high frequency of self-antigen specific regulatory cells that reliably mediate natural tolerance. Negative selection is required to avoid the emergence at the periphery of very high affinity anti-self-regulatory cells that will make the tolerant state so robust that it could no be broken by the introduction of a foreign antigen. This result highlights the importance of repertoire selection in dominant tolerance proposing a novel role for the processes of positive and negative selection within this framework.},

	abstract = {Several reports in the literature have drawn a complex picture of the effect of treatments aiming to modulate IL2 activity in vivo. They seem to promote indistinctly immunity or tolerance, probably depending on the specific context, dose and timing of their application. Such complexity might derives from the dual role of IL2 on T-cell dynamics. To theoretically address the latter possibility, we develop a mathematical model for helper, regulatory and memory T-cells dynamics, which account for most well-known facts relative to their relationship with IL2. We simulate the effect of three types of therapies: IL2 injections, IL2 depletion using anti-IL2 antibodies and IL2/anti-IL2 immune complexes injection. We focus in the qualitative and quantitative conditions of dose and timing for these treatments which allow them to potentate either immunity or tolerance. Our results provide reasonable explanations for the existent pre-clinical and clinical data and further provide interesting practical guidelines to optimize the future application of these types of treatments. Particularly, our results predict that: (i) Immune complexes IL2/anti-IL2 mAbs, using mAbs which block the interaction of IL2 and CD25 (the alpha chain of IL2 receptor), is the best option to potentate immunity alone or in combination with vaccines. These complexes are optimal when a 1:2 molar ratio of mAb:IL2 is used and the mAbs have the largest possible affinity; (ii) Immune complexes IL2/anti-IL2 mAbs, using mAbs which block the interaction of IL2 and CD122 (the beta chain of IL2 receptor), are the best option to reinforce preexistent natural tolerance, for instance to prevent allograft rejection. These complexes are optimal when a 1:2 molar ratio of mAb:IL2 is used and the mAbs have intermediate affinities; (iii) mAbs anti-IL2 can be successfully used alone to treat an ongoing autoimmune disorder, promoting the re-induction of tolerance. The best strategy in this therapy is to start treatment with an initially high dose of the mAbs (one capable to induce some immune suppression) and then scales down slowly the dose of mAb in subsequent applications.},

	abstract = {The class of immunosuppressive lymphocytes known as regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been identified as a key component in preventing autoimmune diseases. Although Tregs have been incorporated previously in mathematical models of autoimmunity, we take a novel approach which emphasizes the importance of professional antigen presenting cells (pAPCs). We examine three possible mechanisms of Treg action (each in isolation) through ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The immune response against a particular autoantigen is suppressed both by Tregs specific for that antigen and by Tregs of arbitrary specificities, through their action on either maturing or already mature pAPCs or on autoreactive effector T cells. In this deterministic approach, we find that qualitative long-term behaviour is predicted by the basic reproductive ratio R(0) for each system. When R(0){\textless}1, only the trivial equilibrium exists and is stable; when R(0){\textgreater}1, this equilibrium loses its stability and a stable non-trivial equilibrium appears. We interpret the absence of self-damaging populations at the trivial equilibrium to imply a state of self-tolerance, and their presence at the non-trivial equilibrium to imply a state of chronic autoimmunity. Irrespective of mechanism, our model predicts that Tregs specific for the autoantigen in question play no role in the system's qualitative long-term behaviour, but have quantitative effects that could potentially reduce an autoimmune response to sub-clinical levels. Our results also suggest an important role for Tregs of arbitrary specificities in modulating the qualitative outcome. A stochastic treatment of the same model demonstrates that the probability of developing a chronic autoimmune response increases with the initial exposure to self antigen or autoreactive effector T cells. The three different mechanisms we consider, while leading to a number of similar predictions, also exhibit key differences in both transient dynamics (ODE approach) and the probability of chronic autoimmunity (stochastic approach).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regulatory T cells are central actors in the maintenance of tolerance of self-antigens or allergens and in the regulation of the intensity of the immune response during infections by pathogens. An understanding of the network of the interaction between regulatory T cells, antigen presenting cells and effector T cells is starting to emerge. Dynamical systems analysis can help to understand the dynamical properties of an interaction network and can shed light on the different tasks that can be accomplished by a network.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a mathematical model to describe a interaction network of adaptive regulatory T cells, in which mature precursor T cells may differentiate into either adaptive regulatory T cells or effector T cells, depending on the activation state of the cell by which the antigen was presented. Using an equilibrium analysis of the mathematical model we show that, for some parameters, the network has two stable equilibrium states: one in which effector T cells are strongly regulated by regulatory T cells and another in which effector T cells are not regulated because the regulatory T cell population is vanishingly small. We then simulate different types of perturbations, such as the introduction of an antigen into a virgin system, and look at the state into which the system falls. We find that whether or not the interaction network switches from the regulated (tolerant) state to the unregulated state depends on the strength of the antigenic stimulus and the state from which the network has been perturbed.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that the interaction network studied in this paper plays an essential part in generating and maintaining tolerance against allergens and self-antigens.},

These insights have raised fundamental questions concerning what constitutes a T(Reg) cell, where they develop and what signals maintain T(Reg)-cell populations in a functional state.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AIMS: Mouse models indicate that adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (Treg) may suppress graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) while preserving graft-versus-leukemia reactions. We aimed to develop a protocol for the efficient isolation and in vitro expansion of donor-derived Treg and to establish the proof-of-concept for the clinical application of ex vivo-generated Treg preparations in five patients with otherwise treatment-refractory chronic GvHD (cGvHD).
METHODS: Allogeneic Treg were isolated from unstimulated leukapheresis products of the corresponding human leukocyte antigen-matched donors by use of clinical-grade magnetic-activated bead sorting. To increase the amount and purity, Treg were cultivated for 7-12 days and infused after a median time of 35 months after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.
RESULTS: Final products contained Treg with a median purity of 84.1\% CD4(+)CD25(high)CD127(low)FOXP3(+)of CD45(+) cells and a mean quantity of 2.4 × 10(6) Treg per kg body wt. All isolated cell products showed in vitro suppressive activity. On transfusion, two of five patients showed a clinical response with improvement of cGvHD symptoms. The other three patients showed stable cGvHD symptoms for up to 21 months. In four of five patients, increased counts of Treg were detectable on Treg transfusion, immunosuppressive treatment could be reduced and suppression of CD69 activation marker expression on T-effector cells was observed. However, one patient had development of malignant melanoma and another patient had Bowen skin cancer 4 months and 11 months after Treg transfusion, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a feasible and reproducible approach of isolating functional Treg in high quantity and purity for clinical application and show opportunities and risks of adoptive Treg transfer into patients with cGvHD.},

	abstract = {Unlike other cell types, T cells do not form spatially arranged tissues, but move independently throughout the body. Accordingly, the number of T cells in the organism does not depend on physical constraints imposed by the shape or size of specific organs. Instead, it is determined by competition for interleukins. From the perspective of classical population dynamics, competition for resources seems to be at odds with the observed high clone diversity, leading to the so-called diversity paradox. In this work we make use of population mechanics, a non-standard theoretical approach to T cell homeostasis that accounts for clone diversity as arising from competition for interleukins. The proposed models show that carrying capacities of T cell populations naturally emerge from the balance between interleukins production and consumption. These models also suggest remarkable functional differences in the maintenance of diversity in naïve and memory pools. In particular, the distribution of memory clones would be biased towards clones activated more recently, or responding to more aggressive pathogenic threats. In contrast, permanence of naïve T cell clones would be determined by their affinity for cognate antigens. From this viewpoint, positive and negative selection can be understood as mechanisms to maximize naïve T cell diversity.},

	abstract = {The quality of life of organ transplant recipients is compromised by complications associated with life-long immunosuppression, such as hypertension, diabetes, opportunistic infections, and cancer. Moreover, the absence of established tolerance to the transplanted tissues causes limited long-term graft survival rates. Thus, there is a great medical need to understand the complex immune system interactions that lead to transplant rejection so that novel and effective strategies of intervention that redirect the system toward transplant acceptance (while preserving overall immune competence) can be identified. This study implements a systems biology approach in which an experimentally based mathematical model is used to predict how alterations in the immune response influence the rejection of mouse heart transplants. Five stages of conventional mouse heart transplantation are modeled using a system of 13 ordinary differential equations that tracks populations of both innate and adaptive immunity as well as proxies for pro- and anti-inflammatory factors within the graft and a representative draining lymph node. The model correctly reproduces known experimental outcomes, such as indefinite survival of the graft in the absence of CD4+ T cells and quick rejection in the absence of CD8+ T cells. The model predicts that decreasing the translocation rate of effector cells from the lymph node to the graft delays transplant rejection. Increasing the starting number of quiescent regulatory T cells in the model yields a significant but somewhat limited protective effect on graft survival. Surprisingly, the model shows that a delayed appearance of alloreactive T cells has an impact on graft survival that does not correlate linearly with the time delay. This computational model represents one of the first comprehensive approaches toward simulating the many interacting components of the immune system. Despite some limitations, the model provides important suggestions of experimental investigations that could improve the understanding of rejection. Overall, the systems biology approach used here is a first step in predicting treatments and interventions that can induce transplant tolerance while preserving the capacity of the immune system to protect against legitimate pathogens.},

In the allograft, Treg cells were activated and subsequently migrated to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) in a CCR2, CCR5, and CCR7 fashion; this movement was essential for optimal suppression. Treg cells inhibited dendritic cell migration in a TGF-beta and IL-10 dependent fashion and suppressed antigen-specific T effector cell migration, accumulation, and proliferation in dLNs and allografts.

We have used immunodeficient Rag 1-/- mice to study the response of T cells to neo-self peripheral Ags in the form of well-healed skin and vascularized cardiac allografts. In this paper we report that skin and cardiac allografts without evidence of inflammation are vigorously rejected by transferred T cells or when recipients are reconstituted with T cells at a physiologic rate by nude bone graft transplantation. These results provide new insights into the role of inflammation or "danger" in the initiation of T cell-dependent immune responses.

Over the past ten to fifteen years, critiques of this model have emerged in both practitioner and academic circles that question the appropriateness of this model based on the type of knowledge that is privileged, the marginalisation of some actors, and the allocation of accountability to individual rather than collective actors. We draw upon case studies from Japan and Chile to examine the ways that participatory guarantee systems (PGS) institute practices for defining, measuring, and assessing sustainability that empower local actors – both producers and consumers. Our cases illustrate that expert and lay knowledges are both relevant and often have different strengths.

Debate would be clarified if such models were employed. We propose that the logistic equation and its extensions like the Lotka-Volterra equations, so familiar to ecologists, can easily be modified to model the important "macro" questions that motivated the three thinkers of our title. The long term rate of population growth must normally be controlled by the rate of improvement in K, the carrying capacity of the earth. K will in turn be controlled by the rate of technological progress. The present situation, in which technological improvement (but also, perhaps, environmental deterioration) are increasing at rates above r, the Malthusian intrinsic rate of natural increase, is probably unique in human history. Can present levels of human prosperity and population growth be sustained? What processes are most likely to determine the answer to this and similar questions? We here sketch a model that endogenizes technological progress and environmental deterioration in the logistic framework. We discuss extensions of the logistic approach to multiple populations, such as other species, and sub-populations, such as human social classes, using the Lotka-Volterra equations.]},

	abstract = {The Green Revolution in India has achieved self-sufficiency in food production. However, in the state of Haryana this has resulted in continuous environmental degradation, particularly of soil, vegetation and water resources. Soil organic matter levels are declining and the use of chemical inputs is intensifying. Newly introduced crop varieties have been responsive to inputs but this has necessitated both increased fertiliser application and use of irrigation resulting in water contamination by nitrate and phosphate and changes in the ground water table. With 82\% of the geographic area already under cultivation, the scope for increased productivity lies in further intensification which is crucially dependent on more energy-intensive inputs. Declining nutrient-use efficiency, physical and chemical degradation of soil, and inefficient water use have been limiting crop productivity, whilst the use of monocultures, mechanisation and an excessive reliance on chemical plant protection have reduced crop, plant and animal diversity in recent years. About 60\% of the geographical area faces soil degradation (waterlogging, salinity and alkalinity) which threatens the region’s food security in the future. Since 1985, the water table has risen more than 1m annually, and patches of salinity have started to appear at the farm level. The situation is worse in higher rainfall areas where waterlogging follows shortly after the rains. Apart from affecting agricultural crops, a high water table causes floods even following slight rains due to the reduced storage capacity of the soil. Such ecological impacts are motivating farmers to reduce fertiliser and pesticides use. This has led to an increased investment in alternative technology and products including an interest in Integrated Pest Management. The paper discusses major physical, hydrological, chemical and biological constraints relating to soil and water resources for ecosystem sustainability.},

	abstract = {Last week, the UN released updated population figures and projections. I just had a chance to go through them and the great key findings document (PDF, 1MB) that accompanies them. But before I dive in, how accurate are these projections? What kind of track record do UN demographers have? The most comprehensive answer I could find was Nico Keilman’s 2001 paper which Hans Rosling refers to in this video. He notes that in 1958, when the UN projected the population in 2000 to be {\textasciitilde}6 Billion (it was then 42 years into the future) they ended up being out by less than 5\%. The short answer is: these projections are pretty good. OK, back to the new data released in 2015: here are some of the trends that stand out for me. Note that I’m using the UN’s regional groupings rather than the World Bank’s. 1) [[tweetable]]The world’s population is projected to reach 11.2 billion in 2100[[/tweetable]] [[asset:tableau:270 \{"mode":"full","align":""\}]] There are 7.3 billion people alive today and while the world’s population continues to grow, it’s growing more slowly than in the past. We can expect to see an additional billion people added over the next 15 years, and about a billion more 10 years later, reaching a total population of 9.7 billion in 2050.},

Studies of the relationship of social class and party identification to voting turnout have reached conflicting conclusions about whether and to what degree they are related. Surveys have indicated other variables that may be useful in the analysis of voting behavior in nonpartisan elections. Although studies have examined in detail the influence of candidate and issue orientations on voting behavior in partisan elections, these two variables have been infrequently considered in analyses of nonpartisan elections, undoubtedly in part because of the unavailability of appropriate data.},

Most of this research focuses on the idea that there is an optimal size and concentration of population that favors active political participation in terms of a higher propensity to vote in local elections, contact local officials, and attend community meetings. The conventional argument suggests a negative relationship between city size and political participation that is mitigated to some extent by the deeper social interactions generated by increased population density. We extend this research by also investigating the influence of population growth on the broader concept of civic participation. Civic participation is a multidimensional concept that requires the use of a broad set of indicators. We expand the number of measures to gauge civic participation at the local level by including data on the formation of volunteer associations, volunteer fire brigades and not-for-profit organizations as well as voter turnout. We test the hypotheses derived from extant research using aggregate data collected from Portuguese cities and discuss the implications of our findings for the literature on local civic participation.},

These inequalities have substantially grown, and the class divide in participation has become greater than the class divide in vote choice between the two main parties. To account for class inequalities in turnout three main hypotheses – to do with policy indifference, policy alienation and social alienation – are tested. The results from the British context suggest that the social background of political representatives influences the ways in which voters participate in the political process, and that the decline in proportion of elected representatives from working-class backgrounds is strongly associated with the rise of working-class abstention.},

This article moves beyond such analyses by applying insights of class segment and social movement analyses to U.S. voter turnout from 1840 to 1996. Beginning with political changes in the late 1800s, I isolate four periods during which turnout rates changed significantly: 1896-1924, 1928-40, 1948-68, and 1960-96. I demonstrate how (1) conflict or consolidation between dominant class segments and (2) the presence or absence of mass social movements combine to influence the amount of mobilization by political parties, which is crucial to voter turnout. When social movements challenge conflicting dominant segments, party mobilization often increases to channel protest into electoral politics, thereby increasing turnout},

	shorttitle = {Contesting {Conservation}},
	abstract = {This book explores today’s changing intellectual climate, wherein understanding politics at different levels from global to local is considered mandatory in order to appraise the outcome of nature conservation interventions. By carefully examining two such processes – the ban on shahtoosh trade and the ‘National Afforestation Programme’ in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, the book reveals how these processes are influenced by politics at different levels – from their introduction at the macro-level to their implementation at the micro-level – and in turn become coloured by the agendas and interests of the various stakeholders involved. Throughout the book, one priority is to give a voice to the poor resource-users who have been traditionally dependent on wildlife and forest resources for mere subsistence. Yet, these same people are who bear the brunt of nature conservation costs, rather than those actors who are responsible for the most serious violations in pursuit of greater profits. Contemporary Environmental Sociology is chiefly characterised by its focus on power relations in resource conservation and management. In ‘political ecology’ literature, too – especially after recognising the paradoxes and limitations of approaches such as ‘sustainable development’, ‘sustainable livelihoods’ and ‘community based natural resource management’ – there is a growing concern for critical analyses of multi-level politics in connection with nature conservation. The purpose of the book is not to challenge the gravity of environmental concerns, but to question the dominance of conservation interests over the subsistence needs of local communities, and to strike a balance between environmental and social justice. It argues that, unless and until more just accountability for the affected populations is ensured, conservation policies are unlikely to meet the goals of sustainable resource management. Given its critical engagement with human-nature conflicts in Jammu and Kashmir, the book offers a unique resource for students and scholars of Environmental Sociology, Political Ecology, Natural Resources Management, Conflict Studies and Human Rights Studies.},

Failure to link ecological processes and their societal benefits has favored highly destructive aquaculture and tourism developments that threaten mangroves and result in costly “externalities.” Specifically, the potentially irreparable damage to fisheries because of mangrove loss has been belittled and is greatly underestimated. Here, we show that, in the Gulf of California, fisheries landings are positively related to the local abundance of mangroves and, in particular, to the productive area in the mangrove–water fringe that is used as nursery and/or feeding grounds by many commercial species. Mangrove-related fish and crab species account for 32\% of the small-scale fisheries landings in the region. The annual economic median value of these fisheries is US \$37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe, falling within the higher end of values previously calculated worldwide for all mangrove services together. The ten-year discounted value of one hectare of fringe is {\textgreater}300 times the official cost set by the Mexican government. The destruction of mangroves has a strong economic impact on local fishing communities and on food production in the region. Our valuation of the services provided by mangroves may prove useful in making appropriate decisions for a more efficient and sustainable use of wetlands.},

Globally, mangrove areas are declining rapidly as they are cleared for coastal development and aquaculture and logged for timber and fuel production. Little is known about the effects of mangrove area loss on individual mangrove species and local or regional populations. To address this gap, species-specific information on global distribution, population status, life history traits, and major threats were compiled for each of the 70 known species of mangroves. Each species' probability of extinction was assessed under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Eleven of the 70 mangrove species (16\%) are at elevated threat of extinction. Particular areas of geographical concern include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America, where as many as 40\% of mangroves species present are threatened with extinction. Across the globe, mangrove species found primarily in the high intertidal and upstream estuarine zones, which often have specific freshwater requirements and patchy distributions, are the most threatened because they are often the first cleared for development of aquaculture and agriculture. The loss of mangrove species will have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities, especially in those areas with low mangrove diversity and high mangrove area or species loss. Several species at high risk of extinction may disappear well before the next decade if existing protective measures are not enforced.},

Restoration efforts have somewhat minimized losses, but has recuperated only a 5\% of the total degraded area. Despite criticized, monospecific plantings have demonstrated return of some ecosystem structure and functioning, and seems to be a starting point in mangrove restoration. Around 70\% of Brazilian mangroves are today inside preserved areas, but the effectiveness of these advances continues impaired by bureaucracy, lack of conservation policies and economic interests. We estimate the status of Brazilian mangroves and review some restoration and conservation efforts, suggesting some management measures like restoration and community-based ecosystem management.

	abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of mangrove management, assessment, and monitoring. It addresses the need for integrated planning and management, based on sound legal principles. The central part of the chapter covers mangrove conservation and planting. Conserving existing mangrove forest is often more effective than planting new forests. When a decision for planting has been made, one has to differentiate between planting on degraded and non-degraded sites and distinguish between replanting, rehabilitation, restoration, and afforestation. Emphasis is put on the need for careful selection of appropriate sites and species and on an ecosystem-based approach to mangrove planting and management which uses and supports natural regeneration and other natural processes. Since the primary intention with any rehabilitation intervention works is for improved protection of existing seedlings and forests from degradation or destruction, then planting should be undertaken only if absolutely necessary. Involving local communities in mangrove management is an effective way of maintaining and enhancing the protection function of the mangrove forest while providing livelihood for local people and contributing to better assessment and governance of natural resources. Assessment of the status of mangrove forests is essential for better conservation planning and management. This includes research and economic assessment and valuation. The last section highlights the importance of applied/participatory as well as academic and long-term monitoring (see also chapter “ Mangroves: Unusual Forests at the Seas’ Edge”).},

	doi = {10.5751/ES-02531-130227},
	abstract = {"In Thailand, mangrove forests are claimed for state management, although it is widely recognized that coastal communities access and manage those forests. Skepticism persists within Thai government circles about whether coastal villages can sustainably manage and protect mangroves. This research presents evidence of successful mangrove conservation and management by two coastal villages in Trang province, southern Thailand. Using interdisciplinary methods including interviews, discussions, quantitative forest surveys, and institutional analysis, we describe the history of how these two communities gained rights to manage the mangrove forests, and the subsequent positive biological outcomes associated with their management. Local villages have crafted and maintained well-defined governance management institutions over the forest, and as a result, stand structure was superior in community-managed mangrove forests than in the open-access state forest. We argue that the basis for the communities success in managing these forests was that the resource was necessary to local livelihoods and was becoming scarce; the communities enjoyed autonomous decision making and had a high degree of social capital; the forest and user groups were well defined and monitored; effective leadership was present in the villages to apply sanctions and resolve conflicts; and there was substantial assistance from an external non-governmental organization, which served as a bridge between the villages and the government. For conservation, simply knowing whether communities can conserve mangroves is not sufficient. We must know why the communities are or are not successful. Conservation research must, therefore, consider not only the biological outcomes of community management, but the underlying reasons for those outcomes. This paper can serve as a guideline for future studies on the community-mangrove interface."},

	abstract = {Community Based Mangrove Management (CBMM) has been advocated by both academia and governing agencies as a viable alternative for sustainably managing the ecologically important mangrove forests which are disappearing rapidly worldwide. Drawing insights from diverse sustainability issues, capabilities and performances of worldwide CBMM initiatives were examined in this paper. Higher numbers of CBMM initiatives were reported from South Asia and lesser from South America and Africa. Identification of the causes of degradation at a site and use-specific zonal replantations with respect to species associations were identified as major criteria of ecological sustainability. Regarding economic sustainability, transformation of potential uses of mangroves known by local communities into actual ones was found to be necessary. Proper disbursement of accrued benefits among community members irrespective of their socio-cultural status is also a major concern. Restructuring of CBMM institutions by ensuring participation of subsistence based users in decision-making and resource sharing have been identified as a prime determinant of institutional sustainability. However, limited number of studies on socio-political and institutional aspects as well as impacts of globalization induced socio-cultural transformations of communities on CBMM had been actually found. More focused researches on these aspects had been recommended for better community management of these highly stressed forests.},

The gas flow rate and calorific value were 3–4 Nm3 kWh−1 and 3.5-5.0 MJ Nm−3, respectively. The cold gas efficiency was 35–60\% over the entire range of loads tested (3.5–11.3 kW). The diesel saving (DS) was nearly independent of the load and was 70–93\% at a pressure drop (ΔP) of 40 cm water gauge (WG); it reduced to 50–70\% at ΔP {\textgreater} 50 cm WG. The indicated thermal efficiency reduced from 18–29\% at 3.5–11.3 kW loads, respectively, in the diesel-alone mode, to 16–26\% at the corresponding loads in the dual-fuel mode. About 15–28\% by weight of the fuel was converted into char with a calorific value of ∼19 MJ kg−1. This char, when mixed with a suitable binder and briquetted, formed an excellent fuel for wood stoves. An economic analysis using the Levelised Annual Cost (LAC) method showed that such gasifiers are more suited for direct heat applications than for shaft power applications at the present level of technology.},

The indirect sources include fuelwood conservation through efficiency improvements and fuelwood savings through fuel switching. The potential of each source is estimated for the base year 1997 as well as for the years 2005 and 2010. The total energy potential of these sources in 1997, 2005 and 2010 is 120 PJ, 133 PJ and 142 PJ, respectively. The corresponding electricity generation potentials are 8.34, 9.24 and 9.85TWh, respectively for a conversion efficiency of 25\%. The annual electricity demand in Sri Lanka 1997 was 4.20TWh and the forecast values for the years 2005 and 2010 are 10.50 and 15.60TWh respectively; this implies that the biomass sources could contribute significantly towards meeting the future electricity requirement.},

However, there are concerns about the sustainability of biomass supplies and the environmental impacts resulting from their use. Use of residues could contribute to ensuring sustainable supply of biomass energy. This study presents findings of an evaluation of the energy potential of agricultural and forest residues in Uganda using census data of the year 2008/2009. Annual productions of crop and forest residues were estimated using residue-to-product ratio (RPR) method. Energy potential of each residue class was then determined basing on their respective lower heating values. The biogas generation potential of each animal category was used to evaluate the energy potential of animal manure. Results showed that the total energy potential of the residues amount to 260 PJ y−1, which is about 70\% of gross biomass energy requirement of Uganda for the year 2008. Crop residues had the highest contribution of about 150 PJ y−1, followed by animal residues with a potential of 65 PJ y−1. Maize residue is the predominant crop residue with energy potential of 65 PJ y−1 followed by beans and banana, each at 16 PJ y−1. This study indicates that agricultural and forest residues can be a major renewable energy source for Uganda. When sustainably utilised, biomass residues could contribute to reduction in environmental degradation in the country.},

	abstract = {Biomass based energy generation is one of the major focus areas of renewable energy programs in India. The strength of India's biomass resources mostly lies in the agricultural sector. A large quantity of crop residue biomass is generated in India. However, crop residue biomasses are distributed resources with variation in spatio-temporal availability and its characteristics. Competing uses of residues also vary geographically. Therefore, local biomass databases are important for decentralized bioenergy programs. However, in India, state wise crop level biomass database is limited. The present paper assessed crop residue biomass and subsequently bioenergy potential in all the 28 states of India using crop statistics and standard procedure. A total of 39 residues from 26 crops cultivated in India are considered for the study. Overall, India produces 686MT gross crop residue biomass on annual basis, of which 234MT (34\% of gross) are estimated as surplus for bioenergy generation. At state level, Uttar Pradesh produces the highest amount of crop residue amongst all the 28 states. Amongst all the crops, sugarcane produces the highest amount of surplus residue followed by rice. The estimated annual bioenergy potential from the surplus crop residue biomass is 4.15EJ, equivalent to 17\% of India's total primary energy consumption. There exists variation from 679MJ (West Bengal) to 16,840MJ (Punjab) of per capita crop residue bioenergy potential amongst the states of India. The information generated in this study is expected to be useful for decentralized crop residue based energy planning by the states of India which in turn would positively influence the overall renewable energy growth in India.},

Both pathways generate a combustible gas: biogas and synthetic gas (syngas), respectively. Biomass gasification generates syngas, which is attractive for energy applications because of its H2, CO, and CH4 contents. Syngas composition varies by reactor operating conditions and can be tailored to specific applications. The two main syngas applications are power generation and fuel synthesis. Gasification is almost as ancient as combustion, but it is less developed because commercial interest in it has not been as strong as in combustion. Thus, the main aim of this paper to provide a comparison of Bagasse (Sugar mill waste) direct combustion and gasification for sugar mill power production. This study is focused on the modelling, simulation and performance analysis of Bagasse gasification processes using Aspen plus Simulation software.},

To facilitate the optimization of the energy efficiency and economic viability of gasification systems, a comprehensive fixed-bed gasification model has been developed to predict the product rate and quality of both biochar and syngas. A coupled transient representative particle and fix-bed model was developed to describe the entire fixed-bed in the flow direction of primary air. A three-region approach has been incorporated into the model, which divided the reactor into three regions in terms of different fluid velocity profiles, i.e. natural convection region, mixed convection region, and forced convection region, respectively. The model could provide accurate predictions against experimental data with a deviation generally smaller than 10\%. The model is applicable for efficient analysis of fixed-bed biomass gasification under variable operating conditions, such as equivalence ratio, moisture content of feedstock, and air inlet location. The optimal equivalence ratio was found to be 0.25 for maximizing the economic benefits of the gasification process.},

	abstract = {The increasing importance of lignocellulosic biomass based energy production has led to an urgent need to conduct a reliable resource supply assessment. This study analyses and estimates the availability of agricultural residue biomass in Beijing, where biomass energy resources are relatively rich and is mainly distributed in the suburbs. The major types of crops considered across Beijing include food crops (e.g., maize, winter wheat, soybean, tubers and rice), cotton crops and oil-bearing crops (e.g., peanuts). The estimates of crop yields are based on historical data between 1996 and 2017 collected from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics. The theoretical and collectable amount of agricultural residues was calculated on the basis of the agricultural production for each crop, multiplied by specific parameters collected from the literature. The assessment of current and near future agricultural residues from crop harvesting and processing resources in Beijing was performed by employing three advanced modeling methods: the Time Series Analysis Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, Least Squares Linear Regression and Gray System Gray Model (GM) (1,1). The results show that the time series model prediction is suitable for short-term prediction evaluation; the least squares fitting result is more accurate but the factors affecting agricultural waste production need to be considered; the gray system prediction is suitable for trend prediction but the prediction accuracy is low.},

Soil samples were collected from experimental plots under a randomized block design using organic (ORG) and conventional (CNV) farming systems to grow acerola (Malpighia glaba L.). A native vegetation (NV) site was used as reference. The highest values of SOC (19.9 and 8.7 g kg-1), were obtained in ORG sites, at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm, respectively, while the lowest values were found in CNV (5.5 and 4.1 g kg-1), and NV (9.7 and 4.5 g kg-1) sites measured at similar depths. MBC and MBN measurements were both higher in ORG soils with MBC measurements of 308 and 122 mg kg-1 in ORG and CNV soil respectively, and MBN values of 72 and 47 mg kg-1 in ORG and CNV soils, respectively. Total enzyme activity was highest in ORG soils with FDA values at 15.2, 6.2, and 8.5 mg kg-1 in ORG, CNV, and NV soils, respectively. DHA values were 5.7, 2.4, 3.2 mg kg-1, in ORG, CNV, and NV soils, respectively. However, the specific activity of enzymes did not vary between systems. The results confirm that inputs of organic residues increase the content of organic C, microbial biomass, and total enzyme activity in soils under the organic farming system. (English)},

The utilisation of agricultural solid biomass as feedstock for energy production is continuously growing all over Europe. As shown in the current country's balance of energy production and consumption, Croatia is highly dependent on imported fossil fuels. The aim of this paper is to determine the available agricultural solid biomass and its energy potential in Croatia. The quantity and energy potential of solid biomass refer to post-harvest residues, pruning residues, agro-industrial solid waste and biomass from Miscanthus energy crop. In relation to potentially available agricultural biomass, three scenarios have been developed (progressive – S1, optimistic - S2, and conservative – S3) of introducing solid biomass in the renewable energy production sector. On the basis of these scenarios, it can be concluded that in Croatia the following quantities of agricultural biomass are available: 3050.3 t (S1); 1441.8 t (S2); and 733.68 t (S3). These quantities give energy potential of 51.14 PJ (S1), 24.06 PJ (S2), and 12.18 PJ (S3) respectively.},

The proposed methodology improves the prediction reliability by following four steps: 1) using a simple accounting framework, 2) using a robust selection of probability density functions, 3) using a probabilistic propagation of uncertainty and 4) using sensitivity analysis to identify key variables contributing to uncertainty as well as a root cause analysis and a set of sub-models to improve estimation of key variables. The application of the methodology to the energy scenario in Colombia shows that the improved estimation of the theoretical energy potential has an almost identical mean value compared to the preliminary estimate, but the uncertainty is significantly lower (less than 50\%). Moreover, the mean value of the technical energy potential obtained through the methodology is 25\% lower than the preliminary potential and the uncertainty reduces by one third.},

	abstract = {Following the global trend of industrial growth, Bangladesh aims towards significant industrial expansion, which is associated with increased energy consumption. Current energy generation in Bangladesh is highly dependent on fossil fuels. However, increasing energy demands, stringent regulations on fossil fuel-based emissions, and concerns related to national energy-security make it imperative to search for alternative energy sources. Biomass-based renewable sources, such as wood, agricultural residues, municipal solid wastes are attractive alternatives to petroleum-based feedstocks for energy and chemicals. Although biomass shows great potential, limited systematic studies exist on biomass as a feedstock in Bangladesh. In this work, we present an overall assessment of the availability and utilization potentials of different biomass resources. A novel feature is the quantitative assessment of major biomass resources, which are unconventional and were previously ignored. It is estimated that the total available biomass from agriculture, waste, industries, animals and other sources could generate more than 3447 petajoules ({\textgreater}950TWh) of energy, which is three times of the current fossils fuel based-energy consumption in Bangladesh. This means that even if only one-third of the overall biomass is utilized for energy generation, it would meet the total energy demand in Bangladesh without utilizing fossil fuels and other sources. A systematic pathway from utilizable biomass to useful chemicals is also presented towards industrial utilization of biomass. This study presents a realistic assessment of available biomass as a prominent source of useful energy and chemicals, and insinuates the potential to be the sustainable source of primary energy that can eventually replace the fossil fuels in the long term.},

	abstract = {The practical application of field or natural leaching to rice straw was evaluated with the goal of improving biomass fuel value. Observations on three rice farms in the Sacramento Valley, California indicated that potassium, chlorine and total ash are leached from rice straw by rainfall regardless of rice variety, grain harvest method, straw arrangement, or stubble length. Leaching of sulfur by natural precipitation was not clearly established. In selected field plots leached straw was successfully collected in spring, even though biomass yields were variable (2.2–3.4Mgha−1) and equipment had to operate in difficult conditions. Total costs for collecting leached straw on an area basis (\$77.07ha−1) are 31\% higher compared to collecting crude straw in the fall (\$58.67ha−1), due to reduced performance of machinery and addition of field curing operations. Analysis of historical rainfall data for the Sacramento Valley revealed that there is an 85\% probability of receiving sufficient rainfall (250mm or more) for substantial natural leaching of straw during the winter period. The available period for mechanized collection of rice straw after the winter period ranges from 0 to 45 days, depending on drying time needed to accomplish favorable field conditions, and planting date of the next crop. The feasibility of spring collection of rice straw could be improved if straw collection equipment were better equipped to operate under wet field conditions. The commercial implementation of natural leaching of rice straw as a strategy to improve fuel quality depends on a combination of factors that include grain harvest and straw collection practices, rainfall intensity and distribution, and field-specific factors.},

The amount of rice straw that may be available as a feedstock ranges from 1.0 to 1.4 million t yr−1. Irrespective of its actual use as a source of raw material for liquid fuel, fiber, or power generation, a study of issues dealing with its harvest is needed. This paper reviews possible harvesting systems and provides an analysis of operating parameters such as straw moisture, density, storage, and optimal number of transport units. A case study of rice straw production in the Sacramento Valley was conducted, which illustrates that 550 t d−1 of straw can be accessed at an estimated net delivered cost of about US \$20/t (dry), which is generally considered attractive for an ethanol feedstock. Gainfully utilizing this residue can ease the disposal problem facing agricultural operations in the State. Furthermore, the potential environmental benefits of diverting rice straw from open-field burning will be to significantly reduce criteria air pollutants such as VOC, SOx, NOx, and PM10, and also silica emissions, which are not specifically monitored but can be a health hazard.},

Meanwhile, the process-based residue, such as bagasse, rice husk, wood residue, palm fiber, palm shell, and saw dust, is used as a fuel for energy production in the agro-industry. Hence, this study is intended to assess the net potential and capacity of alternative agricultural residues, specifically rice straws, to serve as the supplementary fuel for very small power plants (VSPPs) in Thailand. According to the results obtained during the crop season of 2015/2016, approximately 26 Mt of rice straws were generated upon the harvesting process. The net potential of rice straws, including those that were burned and those that were left in the fields, was only about 15\% or 3.85 Mt, which could be used for heat and electricity production at 1331 kilotons of oil equivalent (ktoe) or 457 MWe. As agro-residues vary by seasonality, the peak season of rice straws was in November, where approximately 1.64 Mt (43\%) were generated, followed by December, at 1.32 Mt (34\%). On the basis of the results, rice straw has the potential to serve as a fuel supply for VSPPs at 14.2\%, 21.6\%, 26.3\%, and 29.0\% for the radii of compilation at 24, 36, 48 km and 60 km, respectively.},

The difference in costs is not very significant due to the higher ownership and operating costs of the equipment for using large rectangular bales; however, the specific fuel consumption cost is substantially lower by around 17.5\% and a total transport cost reduction is about 31.5\%. Analysis of the logistics economies of scale for projected power plant capacities of 2–35MWe showed that each doubling the capacity of the energy facility increases the specific costs of the logistics operations only by around 4\% in all regions.},

	abstract = {This research quantified the unit and bulk density of several biomass crops across a variety of harvest and processing methods, as well as the energy and fuel requirements for these operations. A load density of approximately 240 kg·m−3 is needed to reach the legal weight limit of most transporters. Of the three types of balers studied, only the high density (HD) large square baler achieved this target density. However, the specific energy and fuel requirements increased exponentially with bale density, and at the maximum densities for corn stover and switchgrass, the dry basis energy and fuel requirements ranged from 4.0 to 5.0 kW·h·Mg−1 and 1.2 to 1.4 L·Mg−1, respectively. Throughputs of tub grinders when grinding bales was less than any other harvesting or processing methods investigated, so specific energy and fuel requirements were high and ranged from 13 to 32 kW·h·Mg−1 and 5.0 to 11.3 L·Mg−1, respectively. Gross size-reduction by pre-cutting at baling increased bale density by less than 6\% and increased baling energy requirements by 11\% to 22\%, but pre-cut bales increased the tub grinder throughput by 25\% to 45\% and reduced specific fuel consumption for grinding by 20\% to 53\%. Given the improvement in tub grinder operation, pre-cutting bales should be considered as a means to increase grinder throughput. Additional research is needed to determine the energy required to grind high density pre-cut bales at high throughputs so that better estimates of total energy required for a high density bale system can be made. An alternative bulk feedstock system was investigated that involved chopping moist biomass crops with a precision-cut forage harvester, compacting the bulk material in a silo bag, and then segmenting the densified material into modules optimized for efficient transport. The specific fuel use for chopping and then compacting biomass crops in the silo bag ranged from 1.6 to 3.0 L·Mg−1 and 0.5 to 1.3 L·Mg−1, respectively. At the proposed moistures, the compacted density in the silo bags was sufficient to achieve weight-limited transport although there would be less dry matter (DM) shipped than with the high density dry bale system. Additional development work is needed to create transportable modules from the compacted silo bag. The overall results of this research will allow more accurate estimates of biomass logistics costs based on product density and energy expenditures.},

	abstract = {Analysis of Power Requirement of Agricultural Tractor by Major Field Operation Agricultural tractor;Power requirement;Plowing;Rotary tillage;Loader operation; The purpose of this study was to analyze power requirement of an agricultural tractor by major field operations. First a survey was conducted to obtain annual usage ratio of agricultural tractor by field operation. Plowing, rotary tillage, and loader operations were selected as major field operations of agricultural tractor. Second, a power measurement system was constructed with strain-gauge sensors to measure torque of four driving axles and a PTO axle, speed sensors to measure rotational speed of the driving axles and an engine shaft, pressure sensors to measure pressure of hydraulic pumps, an I/O interface to acquire the sensor signals, and an embedded system to calculate power requirement. Third, the major field operations were experimented under fields with different soil conditions following planned operation paths. Power requirement was analyzed during the total operation period consisted of actual operation period (plowing, rotary tillage, and loader operations) and period before and after the actual operation (3-point hitch operating, forward and reverse driving, braking, and steering). Power requirement of tractor major components such as driving axle part, PTO part, main hydraulic part, and auxiliary hydraulic part were measured and calculated to determine usage ratio of agricultural tractor power. Results of averaged power requirement for actual field operation and total operation were 23.1 and 17.5 kW, 24.6 and 19.1 kW, and 14.9 and 8.9 kW, respectively, for plowing, rotary tillage, and loader operations. The results showed that rotary tillage required the greatest power among the operations. Averaged power requirement of driving axles, PTO axle, main hydraulic part, and auxiliary part during the actual field operation were 8.1, 7.8, 3.4, and 1.5 kW, respectively, and the total requirement power was about 70 \% (20.8 kW) of the rated power. Averaged power requirement of driving axles, PTO axle, main hydraulic, and auxiliary hydraulic for the total operation period were 6.5, 6.0, 2.1, 0.9 kW, respectively, and total requirement power was about 52 \% (15.5 kW) of the rated power. Driving axles required the greatest amount of power among the components.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the costs for collecting, handling, and hauling corn stover to an ethanol conversion facility. We estimate costs for a conventional baling system at varying levels of feedstock demand or conversion facility size. Our results generally indicate that stover can be collected, stored, and hauled for about \$43.10–51.60/dry ton using conventional baling equipment for conversion facilities ranging from 500 to 4000 dry tons/day. The cost difference between facility sizes is due to transportation. Transportation, collection and baling, and farmer payments account for over 90\% of total delivered costs. These estimates are based on average corn stover resource availability assumptions and are inclusive of all costs including farmer payments. Under conditions of high resource availability costs can be lowered by \$6–10/dry ton. Delivered costs increase considerably under low resource availability conditions.},

The methodology developed and employed in this study was based on the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and the wind erosion equation (WEQ), which were used to predict individual county-level corn or wheat yields required at harvest to insure that the amount of soil loss would not exceed the tolerable soil loss limit. These yields were then compared to actual county-level corn or wheat yields to determine the quantity of removable residue. Results of this study indicate an annual average of over 42 and 8 million metric tons of corn stover and straw (spring and winter wheat), respectively (46.2 and 8.8 million tons) were potentially available for removal between 1995 and 1997 in these 37 states.},

	abstract = {Mechanized sugarcane green harvesting has been increasingly adopted in Brazil, rising straw availability at the ﬁeld. Computer-aided tools are used to predict the optimum conditions for straw recovery systems. This study aims at developing a model-based method for optimization of sugarcane straw recovery costs and internal rate of return (IRR), as a function of sugarcane productivity, straw recovery fractions and transport distances considering two recovery systems: integral harvesting (IS) and baling system (BS). A simulation procedure using the Virtual Sugarcane Bioreﬁnery (VSB), according to a Central Composite Design (CCD) is used in this study. The scenarios were based on an autonomous ethanol plant, with milling capacity of four million tons per year. The inﬂuence of these agricultural parameters on the sugarcane straw recovery costs and internal rate of return was evaluated through this approach, where the CCD was used for the development of an empirical model for optimization as well as a statistical evaluation of results. An optimized IRR (26.3\%) was obtained for integral system, with low transport distance (20 km), maximum sugarcane stalk productivity (100 t haÀ1) and maximum recovery fraction (70\%). The same conditions lead to higher IRR (26.2\%) for baling system. Results showed that the IS promotes the highest reduction of the agricultural components of straw recovery cost and the optimum IRR considering the vertical integration of sugarcane bioreﬁneries was observed by adopting this system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

About 12 t haÀ1 yrÀ1 of straw can be collected for a typical sugarcane yield of 100 t haÀ1 yrÀ1. The system with the lowest energy consumption was whole-plant harvesting, which used 2.0 L of diesel fuel per tonne of straw collected for a harvest area 30 km from the mill and when 75\% of straw is collected. This value is approximately 40\% lower than of the speciﬁc consumption estimated for the other systems and just 1 e2\% of the energy available from the straw. However, for successful application of the whole-plant harvest system, it is needed signiﬁcant improvements to the efﬁciency of cane cleaning systems for straw separation. The thermal energy available from the straw when 75\% is recovered is 182 GJ haÀ1 yrÀ1, compared to 151 GJ haÀ1 yrÀ1 of the ethanol that can be produced and approximately 174 GJ haÀ1 yrÀ1 from the bagasse. If cane straw were used for electricity generation, an additional 12.6 MWh haÀ1 yrÀ1 could be generated.},

This paper examines published data on collecting corn stover using ÿeld machinery, including moisture content, mass fractions, and the amount of stover removed from the ÿeld. It is shown that a typical sequence of shredding, windrowing and round baling operations may result in a collection e ciency of ¡ 40\%. Other factors such as weather, season, and leaving stover for environmental reasons may also reduce the amount of stover collected per unit area. Collection cost would depend on the amount of stover collected per unit area, the number of operations, machine e ciency in each operation, and bulk density. A typical cost calculated for round baling and delivering the bales to a storage 8 km (5 miles) away from a harvested ÿeld amounted to \$21.60=dry t (\$19.70=dry ton). ? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Collection is still a major challenge in the supply chain of rice straw to prepare feedstock for further use. Straw needs to be gathered from the field and compressed into bales to make it compact and easy to transport. With the introduction of combine harvesters, the collection of rice straw has become harder and more costly. This created negative impacts on other businesses that use rice straw. Mechanization of rice straw collection was introduced in Vietnam in 2013 and it has rapidly developed since. Most of the rice straw produced in the dry season in the Mekong River Delta (MD) of Vietnam is collected for mushroom and for livestock fodder production or for use as mulching materials. In order to quantify the performance of the mechanical operation of rice straw collection, this study conducted an analysis of energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emission (GHGE), and cost of rice straw collection in the MD for five collection machines that operated on the same field, the same rice variety, and the same harvest time under a demonstration in the MD. With rice straw yield of 4.72t per ha, the collection machines operated at a capacity of 0.87–2.47t per hour. This mechanized operation can reduce labor requirement by 90\%. Specific weight of baled straw was from 73 to 104kg per cubic meter, which is heavier by 50–100\% than that of loose-form straw, at a moisture content of 12.4 (±1.21)\% in wet basis. Total energy consumption, ranging from 351 to 588MJ per ton of straw collected, accounted for 10–17\% of the total energy input using this collected straw for biogas production. Energy consumption from fossil fuels results in GHGE of 60–165kg CO2 equivalent per ton of collected straw. The cost of straw collection, which ranged from US\$12 to US\$18 per ton of straw in the MD, accounted for 10–20\% of the total investment cost of biogas or mushroom production. This study illustrated the feasibility of the mechanization of rice straw collection for further processing. Despite the GHGE of this may cause through the consumption of fossil fuels, mechanized rice straw collection creates more benefits such as avoiding in-field burning, producing feedstock for further sustainable processing, and adding value to rice production.},

A sample of cereal farms located in Apulia Region, in Southern Italy, was investigated through a survey questionnaire. Straw incorporation in the soil, straw burning and baling, were the three practices considered. In the light of the ever-growing demand of straw for energy feedstock production, we discussed two scenarios, namely the status quo and the demand pulled scenarios, each one with a different mix of the three straw end-practices. Following farmer's intentions, in the demand pulled scenario a high percentage of straw was baled while reducing straw incorporation; straw burning practice was not eliminated because it allows farmers to prepare the soil for cultivation. Sensitivity analysis tested different wheat and straw allocation methods (economic vs mass and cereal unit allocation). The environmental impact of alternative straw end-practices and scenarios was assessed by means of an attributional Life Cycle Assessment. Straw incorporation resulted the best environmental practice. Scenarios had quite similar impacts for 8 out of 11 impact categories, but the demand pulled scenario was less impacting than the status quo on global warming, human toxicity, and photochemical oxidation impact categories. These results allow us to conclude that the perspective of selling the straw on the local market for energy production is a better solution compared to the current situation.},

Only about 20\% of rice straw was used for purposes such as ethanol, paper, fertilizers and fodders and the remaining amount is either removed from the field, in situ burned, piled or spread in the field, incorporated in the soil, or used as mulch for the following crop. Collection and management of rice straw is still a major challenge, for the environmental and economic reasons, rice straw should be collected and used to produce energy or to be under different management options, a proposition that becomes unfeasible over long distances due to the low density of rice straw. Considering the economic aspects, the amount of rice straw available for use will be very limited if there is no better way to collect and transfer the straw compared to woody biomass, a fuel with much better transportability.},

	abstract = {Crop residues have an essential role in sustaining soil functions and the removal of sugarcane straw for bioenergy production can exacerbate the adverse impacts of mechanized harvesting on soil quality. A long-term field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of straw removal on soil physical quality in southern Brazil. We performed a multi-approach assessment including quantitative physical indicators (bulk density–BD; soil resistance to penetration–SRP; macroporosity–MaP; microporosity–MiP; mean weight diameter of aggregates–MWD), biological indicator (earthworm abundance), apparent electric conductivity (ECa) and visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS). In addition, VESS scores were correlated with quantitative indicators for testing its potential as a feasible integrative soil quality indicator. Straw removal rates (total removal, TR–0 Mg ha−1; high removal, HR–5 Mg ha−1; low removal, LR–10 Mg ha−1; no removal, NR–15 Mg ha−1) were arranged in a randomized block design with four repetitions. Except for MaP, straw removal for four years affected all soil physical attributes, with higher soil degradation observed in TR and HR plots. Soil moisture, earthworm abundance and ECa values were reduced by higher rates of straw removal. The VESS method was able to detect the changes in soil structural quality, and VESS scores averaged 4.5 and 3.9 for the TR and HR plots respectively, thus revealing signals of severe structural degradation. The data also showed that VESS scores correlated with quantitative indicators broadly used for soil assessments, which suggest VESS as a reliable and integrative indicator for monitoring soil structural quality in sugarcane fields. Our findings support that LR, keeping about 10 Mg ha-1 of straw on the soil surface, can be a management target to ensure the sustainability of bioenergy production.},

Sustainable use of agricultural residues for bioenergy production requires consideration of the important role that residues play in limiting soil erosion and maintaining soil C, health, and productivity. Increased availability of subfield-scale data sets such as grain yield data, high-fidelity digital elevation models, and soil characteristic data provides an opportunity to investigate the impacts of subfield-scale variability on sustainable agricultural residue removal. Using three representative fields in Iowa, this study contrasted the results of current NRCS conservation management planning analysis with subfield-scale analysis for rake-and-bale removal of agricultural residue. The results of the comparison show that the field-average assumptions used in NRCS conservation management planning may lead to unsustainable residue removal decisions for significant portions of some fields. This highlights the need for additional research on subfield-scale sustainable agricultural residue removal including the development of real-time variable removal technologies for agricultural residue.},

Mechanized harvesting consists in a sequence of operations which includes cutting the pointer and chopping the stalk.

An economic way to retract this straw is using mechanized processing for bailing it, involving hay balers, which are imported to Brazil and their use require regularly field conditions of work. Those balers could produce square or round bales, which can be sold to energy generation. This study aims to estimate economic efficiency indicators of round and square systems for sugarcane straw, establishing a relationship between baling costs and the incoming generated from those bales. Based on data set, round baling system was 26\% more efficient than square baling system, and that round baler has a lower purchase price and a higher compress ratio of biomass, allowing a greater potential for power generation, turning it a more advantageous in a possible marketing for bales produced.},

Factors that affect large square bale production and handling logistics were quantified. Field operations of a large square baler, two bale handlers, and three bale trucks were observed in a full day field operation. System performance was analyzed and material capacities of all machines used in this system were determined based on field measurements. System limitations were quantified, and means to increase system efficiency or reduce production costs were discussed. Results showed that 340 wheat straw bales at a density of 116 kg·m-3 (wet matter) were made with a single large square baler during 8 h field operations. The number of bales produced was the system limitation when one baler, two bale handlers and three bale trucks were used. Adding a baler or reduce the number of operators can increase system efficiency. The large square baler used in this study had a material capacity of 13 Mg·h-1. Similar baling trials were conducted in a switchgrass field and results indicated that the baler had the same material capacity.},

First results for beech wood obtained in a side stream at the laboratory plant at Fraunhofer UMSICHT indicate, that the middle fraction is well suited for the production of high value phenolic resins, while the two other fractions also concentrate other valuable components. The fraction with low boiling components offer the possibility to produce acetic acid or biogas and the high boiling fraction can substitute biomass in gasification processes or heating oil in residential houses. Other utilization purposes will be evaluated in future research.},

	abstract = {This study provides a spatially comprehensive assessment of sustainable agricultural residue removal potential across the United States for bioenergy production. Earlier assessments determining the quantity of agricultural residue that could be sustainably removed for bioenergy production at the regional and national scale faced a number of computational limitations. These limitations included the number of environmental factors, the number of land management scenarios, and the spatial fidelity and spatial extent of the assessment. This study utilizes integrated multi-factor environmental process modeling and high fidelity land use datasets to perform the sustainable agricultural residue removal assessment. Soil type represents the base spatial unit for this study and is modeled using a national soil survey database at the 10–100m scale. Current crop rotation practices are identified by processing land cover data available from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer database. Land management and residue removal scenarios are identified for each unique crop rotation and crop management zone. Estimates of county averages and state totals of sustainably available agricultural residues are provided. The results of the assessment show that in 2011 over 150 million metric tons of agricultural residues could have been sustainably removed across the United States. Projecting crop yields and land management practices to 2030, the assessment determines that over 207 million metric tons of agricultural residues will be able to be sustainably removed for bioenergy production at that time. This biomass resource has the potential for producing over 68 billion liters of cellulosic biofuels.},

	abstract = {Global energy demand of 424EJyear−1 in 2000 is increasing at the rate of 2.2\% year−1. There is a strong need to increase biofuel production because of the rising energy costs and the risks of global warming caused by fossil fuel combustion. Biofuels, being C-neutral and renewable energy sources, are an important alternative to fossil fuels. Therefore, identification of viable sources of biofuel feedstock is a high priority. Harvesting lignocellulosic crop residues, especially of cereal crops, is being considered by industry as one of the sources of biofuel feedstocks. Annual production of lignocellulosic residues of cereals is estimated at 367millionMgyear−1 (75\% of the total) for the U.S., and 2800millionMgyear−1 (74.6\% of the total) for the world. The energy value of the residue is 16×106BTUMg−1. However, harvesting crop residues would have strong adverse impact on soil quality. Returning crop residues to soil as amendments is essential to: (a) recycling plant nutrients (20–60kg of N, P, K, Ca per Mg of crop residues) amounting to 118millionMg of N, P, K in residues produced annually in the world (83.5\% of world's fertilizer consumption), (b) sequestering soil C at the rate of 100–1000kgCha−1year−1 depending on soil type and climate with a total potential of 0.6–1.2PgCyear−1 in world soils, (c) improving soil structure, water retention and transmission properties, (d) enhancing activity and species diversity of soil fauna, (e) improving water infiltration rate, (f) controlling water runoff and minimizing risks of erosion by water and wind, (g) conserving water in the root zone, and (h) sustaining agronomic productivity by decreasing losses and increasing use efficiency of inputs. Thus, harvesting crop residues as biofuel feedstock would jeopardize soil and water resources which are already under great stress. Biofuel feedstock must be produced through biofuel plantations established on specifically identified soils which do not compete with those dedicated to food crop production. Biofuel plantations, comprising of warm season grasses (e.g., switch grass), short rotation woody perennials (e.g., poplar) and herbaceous species (e.g., miscanthus) must be established on agriculturally surplus/marginal soils or degraded/desertified soils. Plantations established on such soils would restore degraded ecosystems, enhance soil/terrestrial C pool, improve water resources and produce biofuel feedstocks.},

	abstract = {Although the transition towards replacing fossil fuels with renewable energies is increasing worldwide, using renewable resources and appropriate technologies are still challenging in developing countries. Biomass feedstock is receiving increased attention in Bolivia, a South American country, to increase access to renewable electricity and ensure a sustainable energy source. To develop biomass-based energy conversion facilities, it is critical to understand the biomass availability in Bolivia. This study quantified the sustainable agricultural residue biomass available throughout the country for energy generation purposes. The quantification process used statistical crop production information and correcting factors, including leftovers for soil conservation, animal feeding, etc. Following that, a geographic information system (GIS) was used to create maps showing the spatial distribution of residues in order to identify the municipalities that generate the largest volumes of agricultural residues. The results show that the major residues are from sugarcane, soybean, corn, rice, sorghum, and sunflower, which generate 3.8 M dry t/yr of biomass across the country. Most of the available biomass is generated in Santa Cruz, one of the country's nine departments, where biomass potential is estimated at 3.7 M dry t/yr. Ten neighboring municipalities in this department are identified as major residue producers with a biomass potential of 3.2 M dry t/yr, equivalent to an energy potential of 4.5 TWh and power generation of 722 MW, assuming 30\% plant efficiency and 0.72 capacity factor. The biomass energy potential from these ten municipalities is equivalent to 50\% of the annual electricity production. Moreover, it could supply energy to 58\% of the population. These results demonstrate the vast potential in Bolivia to replace fossil fuels with residue biomass in producing energy.},

A large quantity of biomass residue is generated from agricultural crop production. However, the biomass residues are the distributed resources with variation in spatio-temporal availability and its characteristics which their energy potential depends on. Biomass residues are emerged after harvesting of main crops as stalks, straw, stems and leaves, husks, cobs and etc. In this study, agricultural biomass residues energy potential was explored for Turkey using conducted studies of agricultural biomass residues characteristics in several countries located at different geographic regions. Data on characteristics of agricultural biomass residues were used from 16 European Union countries, as well as in India, Cameroon, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Uganda and Turkey. Some residue characteristics such as residue product ratios, moisture levels, and lower heating calorific values of dry matter were taken into account. Furthermore, a mathematical model was defined for the calculation of the energy potential of Turkey's agricultural biomass residues. Theoretical biomass amount and theoretical energy potential, as well as available energy potential values of agricultural biomass residues were determined. The total amounts of biomass residues obtained from arable field crops and horticultural crops in Turkey were estimated as 59,432 kilotonne and 15,652 kilotonne respectively. The theoretical energy potential of these all agricultural biomass residues were calculated as 908,119 TJ and 90,354 TJ, respectively. The available energy potentials from agricultural biomass residues were calculated as 298,955 TJ for arable agricultural field crops and 65,491 TJ for horticultural crops.},

	abstract = {Crop residues are a potential source of renewable feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol production because of their high cellulose content and easy availability. Indiscriminate removal as biofuel may, however, have adverse impacts on soil, environment, and crop production. This article reviews available information on the impacts of crop residue removal on soil properties, crop yields, and soil erosion across a wide range of soils and ecosystems. It explicitly synthesizes data on the independent impacts of crop residue removal on soil and environment rather than on the interrelated tillage-crop-residue management impacts. Published literature shows that residue removal adversely impacts near-surface soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Unmulched soils are prone to particle detachment, surface sealing, crusting, and compaction. Residue removal reduces input of organic binding agents essential to formation and stability of aggregates. It also closes open-ended biochannels by raindrop impacts and reduces water infiltration, saturated/unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, and air permeability, and thereby increases runoff/soil erosion and transport of non-point source pollutants (e.g., sediment and chemicals). Residue removal accelerates evaporation, increases diurnal fluctuations in soil temperature, and reduces input of organic matter needed to improve the soils' ability to retain water. It reduces macro- (e.g., K, P, N, Ca, and Mg) and micronutrient (e.g., Fe, Mn, B, Zn, and S) pools in the soil by removing nutrient-rich residue materials and by inducing losses of soil organic matter (SOM)-enriched sediments in runoff. Residue removal drastically reduces earthworm population and microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) biomass. It adversely affects agronomic production by altering the dynamics of soil water and temperature regimes. The short-term ( {\textless} 10 yr) data show nevertheless that residue removal may not always degrade soil physical properties and decrease crop yields in the short term depending on the soil type, topography, and fluctuations in annual weather conditions. Sloping and erosion-prone soils are more rapidly and adversely affected by residue removal than those on flat terrains with heavy texture and poorly drained conditions. Sloping terrains are not only highly susceptible to water and wind erosion but also to tillage erosion. In these soils, therefore, a fraction of the total crop residue produced may be available for biofuel production and other expanded uses. Standard guidelines on when, where, and how much residues to remove need to be, however, established. Modeling rates of residue removal are presently based on the needs of soil cover to control erosion without consideration to maintaining SOM and nutrient pools, enhancing soil physical, chemical, and biological quality, and sustaining crop production. Threshold levels of residue removal must be assessed for principal soil types based on the needs to maintain or enhance soil productivity and improve environmental quality. For those soils in which some residues are removed, best management practices (e.g., cover crops, diverse crop rotations, and manure application) must be adopted to minimize adverse impacts of residue removal. Because indiscriminate harvesting of crop residues for biofuel may deteriorate soil properties, reduce crop yields, and degrade the environment, there exists an urgent research need for developing alternative sustainable renewable energy feedstocks (e.g., warm season grasses and short-rotation woody crops).},

The estimation of the potential amount of agricultural residue available in 2015 in each region of France is calculated. The residues considered in this study come from cereal straw and corn stover. Results show that eight out of the twenty one French regions have enough agricultural residues available to supply at least one 200 million liter biofuel plant. Region Centre has the largest potential, with enough residues to supply three to five plants. Finally, cost of supplying one biodiesel plant of 200 million liters in the region Centre is estimated. Results show that collection of biomass will be effective in an area with a radius of 58 Km to 168 Km depending of the raw material considered and its abundance. The cost of supplying a plant with miscanthus is much higher than with residues only. Thus, crop residues appear to offer a lower cost to produce biodiesel in the near term compared to a dedicated crop. Results show that production of biofuel from cellulosic biomass should not be limited by the supply of raw material, but costs of conversion to liquid fuels clearly will play a key role in the development of cellulosic biofuels. Energy prices and policies will have a significant impact on second generation biofuel development.},

	abstract = {Energy balances are analysed from a life-cycle perspective for biogas systems based on 8 different raw materials. The analysis is based on published data and relates to Swedish conditions. The results show that the energy input into biogas systems (i.e. large-scale biogas plants) overall corresponds to 20–40\% (on average approximately 30\%) of the energy content in the biogas produced. The net energy output turns negative when transport distances exceed approximately 200km (manure), or up to 700km (slaughterhouse waste). Large variations exist in energy efficiency among the biogas systems studied. These variations depend both on the properties of the raw materials studied and on the system design and allocation methods chosen. The net energy output from biogas systems based on raw materials that have high water content and low biogas yield (e.g. manure) is relatively low. When energy-demanding handling of the raw materials is required, the energy input increases significantly. For instance, in a ley crop-based biogas system, the ley cropping alone corresponds to approximately 40\% of the energy input. Overall, operation of the biogas plant is the most energy-demanding process, corresponding to 40–80\% of the energy input into the systems. Thus, the results are substantially affected by the assumptions made about the allocation of a plant's entire energy demand among raw materials, e.g. regarding biogas yield or need of additional water for dilution.},

	abstract = {With increasing use of biomass for energy, questions arise about the validity of bioenergy as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology able to reveal these environmental and energy performances, but results may differ even for apparently similar bioenergy systems. Differences are due to several reasons: type and management of raw materials, conversion technologies, end-use technologies, system boundaries and reference energy system with which the bioenergy chain is compared. Based on review of published papers and elaboration of software data concerning greenhouse gas and energy balances of bioenergy, other renewable and conventional fossil systems, this paper discusses key issues in bioenergy system LCA. These issues have a strong influence on the final results but are often overlooked or mishandled in most of the studies available in literature. The article addresses the following aspects: recognition of the biomass carbon cycle, including carbon stock changes in biomass and soil over time; inclusion of nitrous oxide and methane emissions from agricultural activities; selection of the appropriate fossil reference system; homogeneity of the input parameters in Life Cycle Inventories; influence of the allocation procedure when multiple products are involved; future trends in bioenergy (i.e. second-generation biofuels and biorefineries). Because many key issues are site-specific, and many factors affect the outcome, it is not possible to give exact values for the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and fossil energy consumption saved by a certain bioenergy product, because too many uncertainties are involved. For these reasons, the results are here provided as a means of wide ranges. Despite this wide range of results, it has been possible to draw some important conclusions and devise recommendations concerning the existing bioenergy systems, and some emerging implications about the future deployment and trends of bioenergy products are pointed out.},

Further, the energy savings and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential of replacing natural gas-based electricity by bioenergy have been assessed. To this end, a methodology has been developed based on an integrated evaluation, incorporating statistical and geographical information system (GIS)-based analysis, and a life-cycle-assessment approach. Results reveal that the environmentally sustainable generation potential is nearly 141 TWh/year, mainly concentrated in the South, Southeast, and Midwest regions of the country. Sugarcane, soybean and maize crop residues are the major feedstocks for available bioenergy. On the other hand, the economic potential is far lower, accounting to 39 TWh/year. The total GHG mitigation is nearly 18 million tonne CO2e and could reach 64 million tonne CO2e yearly, if the technical potential is considered. The gap between technical and economic potentials implies that constraints to bioenergy are not related to a lack of resources, but rather associated to economic, logistical, regulatory and political barriers.},

	abstract = {The production of biofuels, bioenergy and chemical intermediates from biomass is a promising solution to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. While a significant research effort has been devoted to biomass production and conversion processes, the importance of logistics was detected more recently. Indeed, efficient supply chains are essential to provide conversion facilities with sufficient quantities of quality biomass at reasonable prices. As large territories and hundreds of biomass producers are involved, quantitative models are very useful to evaluate and optimize the resources required, the associated costs, the energy consumptions and the environmental impacts. This article surveys the recent research on models for biomass supply chains, from an Operations Research perspective. 124 references, including 72 published since 2010, have been analyzed to present the structures and the activities of these chains, a typology of decisions in three levels (strategic, tactical and operational), and a review of models based either on performance evaluation techniques (e.g., simulation) or mathematical optimization. A conclusion underlines the contributions and shortcomings of current research and suggests possible directions.},

The prerequisites of straw harvest were investigated for three Swedish regions with different climatic and geographical conditions. As a fuel in district heating plants, the simulations showed that straw has the best opportunity of becoming economically competitive in agricultural districts in south Sweden. The simulations demonstrated, however, that the costs can be lowered and the system performance increased for these places by using appropriate management strategies. SHAM was also used to determine the number of machines in the handling operations in order to minimize the total fuel costs for a straw- and oil-fired district heating plant. The optimizations showed that straw can be delivered to the plant at a cost of 29.9 SEK GJ−1. Finally, two alternatives to the conventional high-density baler systems were evaluated; systems based on compact rolls and systems based on chopped straw stored outdoors. It was demonstrated that these technologies cost about 5–20\% more compared with high-density bales. However, their prospects of becoming competitive harvest methods for the future are good.},

The costs for harvest, transport and storage of this bulky fuel are, however, high, because it is produced over large areas and must be collected during a limited amount of days into intermediate storages before being ultimately transported to heating plants. This paper presents a dynamic simulation model for analysis of various delivery alternatives in order to improve and optimize system performance and to reduce the costs and energy needed in straw handling. The model, called SHAM (Straw HAndling Model), is based on submodels associated with infrastructural and geographical aspects, as well as with field drying and weather conditions. A simplified empirical field drying model has been developed, which is used to predict the straw moisture content at any time. The harvesting seasons can be simulated to compare different machinery chains, management strategies and plant locations. A large number of system performance measures can be studied, for example, utilization times of machinery, the time the straw has to wait for different resources, and the amount of straw that the machines are able to harvest per season. The validity of SHAM has been established by comparisons with existing harvesting systems.},

To design it, this paper proposed a mixed integer linear programming model. It covered from planting and harvesting switchgrass to delivering to a biorefinery and included the residue handling, concentrating on integrating strategic decisions on the supply chain design and tactical decisions on the annual operation schedules. The present numerical examples verified the model and demonstrated its use in practice. This paper showed that the operations of the logistics system were significantly different for harvesting and non-harvesting seasons, and that under the well-designed biomass logistics system, the mass production with a steady and sufficient supply of biomass can increase the unit profit of bioenergy. The analytical model and practical methodology proposed in this paper will help realize the commercial production in biomass-to-bioenergy industry.},

Since harvest windows differ across species, gasification–fermentation technology would enable the use of specialized harvest and collection machinery throughout many months and reduce the fixed costs of harvest machinery per unit of feedstock. This study was conducted to determine the cost to harvest lignocellulosic biomass for use as biorefinery feedstock, and to determine the potential economies of size that might result from a coordinated structure. An agricultural machinery cost computer program was used to determine which specific type of machines would result in the lowest costs at intensive levels of use. A machinery complement estimator was used to design a coordinated set of machines and estimate costs for owning and operating the machines. The designed coordinated harvest unit includes ten laborers, nine tractors, three mowers, three rakes, three balers, and one bale transporter. The cost for mowing, raking, baling, gathering, and stacking in-field was estimated to be from \$11.26 to \$14.01Mg−1 depending upon biomass yield. A biorefinery with an annual feedstock requirement of 910Ggyr−1 would require approximately 18 harvest units and an average machinery investment of \$11 million. Additional research is necessary to determine the cost to procure material from the landowner, the cost to store, storage losses, and the cost to transport feedstock from in-field stacks to a biorefinery.},

Akinnuli \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Abstract Machinery selection is a vital element in planning implementation and operation of agricultural services used for large or small scale mechanized schemes. The major problem is inability to select tractor and implement as per size that can easily works with the selected tractor. Optionally, to reduce time and increase productivity. A mathematical model for machinery selection was developed. The model was based on the concept of obtaining the optimum width of a machine using power of the tractor and implement and economic optimization method. The model was developed to predict the size of tractor and implement that can be required to complete the farm operations during a specific time. The compatibility of tractor and implement was determined proper matching the available tractor power with the optimum implements width obtained and compute the field time required for a machine to complete a certain operation. The field capacity of the machine and fuel consumption was also determined. There is little difference (at 0.95 and 0.99\%) when the model is compared with the Case International Method (plastic ruler) irrespective of soil or machine type. The developed model when tested gave a result of 0.95 \% compared with the Cast International method of 0.99 \%. However, the model was found sensitive to speed, soil conditions, and cultivable area and not sensitive to purchase price. The results of the model application are found almost identical with actual data of Rahad Agricultural Scheme – Sudan except the fuel consumption, which was slightly less in case of the model (MF 120 hp tractor and Baldan5discs plough of 1500 mm width implement). Hence, the developed model can be used to aid decision – makers in selecting the optimum tractor–machine complement size and in scheduling machinery fleet. This aid in calculating the required working hours of farm machinery like tractor and other farm machines on field operation.The algorithm determines the optimum sizes of farm machinery and tractor power by considering farm sizes, cropping pattern, soil conditions and weather variability. The model was designed so as to minimize farm total cost.The approach matched the tractor – implement width via consideration of soil conditions, soil attractive force, engine power and speed. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_},

In this study, we calculate for small- and large-project sizes, the relative cost of transportation by truck, rail, ship, and pipeline for three biomass feedstocks, by truck and pipeline for ethanol, and by transmission line for electrical power. Distance fixed costs (loading and unloading) and distance variable costs (transport, including power losses during trans-mission), are calculated for each biomass type and mode of transportation. Costs are normalized to a common basis of a giga joules of biomass. The relative cost of moving products vs feedstock is an approximate measure of the incentive for location of biomass processing at the source of biomass, rather than at the point of ultimate consumption of produced energy. In general, the cost of transporting biomass is more than the cost of transporting its energy products. The gap in cost for transporting biomass vs power is significantly higher than the incremental cost of building and operating a power plant remote from a transmission grid. The cost of power transmission and ethanol transport by pipeline is highly dependent on scale of project. Transport of ethanol by truck has a lower cost than by pipeline tip to capacities of 1800 t/d. The high cost of transshipment to a ship precludes shipping from being an economical mode of transport for distances less than 800 km (woodchips) and 1500 km (baled agricultural residues).},

Three types of biomass i.e., wheat straw, corn stover and forest biomass were considered in different forms such as loose biomass, bales/bundles, chopped/chipped and pellets. It was found that the delivery cost of a combination of woody and agricultural biomass feedstocks is lower than that for a single type of biomass. The delivery of agricultural residues as bales and woody biomass as chips is an economically attractive option with optimal combination of 30\% bales and 70\% wood chips to a biorefinery of capacity 5000 dry tonnes per day. The anticipated traffic congestions resulting from biomass supply to a large facility could be significantly reduced by increasing the density of biomass. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {With cellulosic energy production from biomass becoming popular in renewable energy research, agricultural producers may be called upon to plant and collect corn stover or harvest switchgrass to supply feedstocks to nearby facilities. Determining the production and transportation cost to the producer of corn stover or switchgrass and the amount available within a given distance from the plant will result in a per metric ton cost the plant will need to pay producers in order to receive sufficient quantities of biomass. This research computes up-to-date biomass production costs using recent prices for all important cost components including seed, fertilizer, herbicide, mowing/shredding, raking, baling, storage, handling, and transportation. The cost estimates also include nutrient replacement for corn stover. The total per metric ton cost is a combination of these cost components depending on whether equipment is owned or custom hired, what baling options are used, the size of the farm, and the transport distance. Total costs per dry metric ton for biomass with a transportation distance of 60 km ranges between \$63 and \$75 for corn stover and \$80 and \$96 for switchgrass. Using the county quantity data and this cost information, we then estimate biomass supply curves for three Indiana coal-fired electric utilities. This supply framework can be applied to plants of any size, location, and type, such as future cellulosic ethanol plants. Finally, greenhouse gas emissions reductions are estimated from using biomass instead of coal for part of the utility energy and also the carbon tax required to make the biomass and coal costs equivalent. Depending on the assumed CO2 price, the use of biomass instead of coal is found to decrease overall costs in most cases.},

An economic and environmental evaluation and technical field testing of a straw baler with 4 ha/day capacity was therefore conducted in Long An province. During the field testing data on the gathering capacity, fuel consumption, labor requirement and other cost items were collected. The test results showed that the baling cost is US\$19.0 per ton of rice straw, the pay-back period of 2.1 years and the internal rate of return of 38\%. In addition to the baling cost, the transportation cost varies from US\$24 for a distance of 100 km to US\$32 for 150 km.

	abstract = {As biorefining conversion technologies become commercial, feedstock availability, supply system logistics, and biomass material attributes are emerging as major barriers to the availability of corn stover for biorefining. While systems do exist to supply corn stover as feedstock to biorefining facilities, stover material attributes affecting physical deconstruction, such as densification and post-harvest material stability, challenge the cost-effectiveness of present-day feedstock logistics systems. In addition, the material characteristics of corn stover create barriers with any supply system design in terms of equipment capacity/efficiency, dry matter loss, and capital use efficiency. However, analysis of a conventional large square bale corn stover feedstock supply system concludes that (1) where other agronomic factors are not limiting, corn stover can be accessed and supplied to a biorefinery using existing bale-based technologies, (2) technologies and new supply system designs are necessary to overcome biomass bulk density and moisture material property challenges, and (3) major opportunities to improve conventional bale biomass feedstock supply systems include improvements in equipment efficiency and capacity and reducing biomass losses in harvesting, collection, and storage. Finally, the backbone of an effective stover supply system design is the optimization of intended and minimization of unintended material property changes as the corn stover passes through the individual supply system processes from the field to the biorefinery conversion processes.},

	abstract = {Corn stover is the residue that is left behind after corn grain harvest. We have constructed a life-cycle model that describes collecting corn stover in the state of Iowa, in the Midwest of the United States, for the production and use of a fuel mixture consisting of 85\% ethanol/15\% gasoline (known as “E85”) in a flexible-fuel light-duty vehicle. The model incorporates results from individual models for soil carbon dynamics, soil erosion, agronomics of stover collection and transport, and biocon-version of stover to ethanol. Limitations in available data forced us to focus on a scenario that assumes all farmers in the state of Iowa switch from their current cropping and tilling practices to continuous production of corn and “no-till” practices. Under these conditions, which maximize the amount of collectible stover, Iowa alone could produce almost 8 billion liters per year of pure stover-derived ethanol (E100) at prices competitive with today's corn-starch-derived fuel ethanol. Soil organic matter, an important indicator of soil health, drops slightly in the early years of stover collection but remains stable over the 90-year time frame studied. Soil erosion is controlled at levels within tolerable soil-loss limits established for each county in Iowa by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We find that, for each kilometer fueled by the ethanol portion of E85, the vehicle uses 95\% less petroleum compared to a kilometer driven in the same vehicle on gasoline. Total fossil energy use (coal, oil, and natural gas) and greenhouse gas emissions (fossil CO2, N2O, and CH4) on a life-cycle basis are 102\% and 113\% lower, respectively. Air quality impacts are mixed, with emissions of CO, NOx, and SOx increasing, whereas hydrocarbon ozone precursors are reduced. This model can serve as a platform for future discussion and analysis of possible scenarios for the sustainable production of transportation fuels from corn stover and other agricultural residues.},

The presented modeling system estimates the costs and environmental implications of supplying specified amounts of energy crop feedstock across a state. The system considers where energy crops could be grown, the spatial variability in their yield, and transportation costs associated with acquiring feedstock for an energy facility. The modeling system was used to estimate potential switchgrass costs and supplies in eleven US states. Transportation costs increased with increased facility demand and were lowest in Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota and highest in South Carolina, Missouri, Georgia, and Alabama. Farmgate feedstock costs were lowest in Alabama, North Dakota and South Dakota and highest in Iowa and Nebraska. Across the eleven states, delivered feedstock costs ranged from \$33 to \$55/dry tonne to supply a facility requiring 100,000 tonne/yr. Delivered feedstock costs for a 630,000 tonne/yr facility ranged from \$36 to \$58/dry tonne.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in sugarcane straw removal from the field to use as raw material for bioenergy production. In contrast, sugarcane straw removal may have negative implications for many soil ecosystem services and subsequent plant growth. A two-year experiment was conducted at Bom Retiro and Univalem mills within the dry and wet seasons for assessing the impact of straw rates removal on plant production. The experimental design was randomized blocks with five treatments proportional to 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100\% of straw removal. Plant parameters evaluated included: tillering, phytomass accumulation, stalk yield and stalk industrial quality. Straw removal increased plant tillering at Bom Retiro mill in both seasons and within dry season at Univalem mill, however the plant population at the end of each ratoon cycle was not affected by straw management. Phytomass yield across each ratoon cycle was fit to a sigmoidal model (R2≥0.92, p{\textless}0.05). Time necessary for plant completes its lag-phase is higher at the treatments applied in the dry season, whereas there was no time-pattern for plants to complete the linear and stationary growth phases. Moderate amounts of straw: 4–9Mgha−1 (dry base) on soil surface enhanced stalk yield. Different rates of straw removal did not affect stalk industrial quality. Overall, partial straw removal, at least in the short-term, could be a win–win situation, sustaining sugarcane yields and providing feedstock for bioelectricity cogeneration and/or 2G-ethanol production.},

The model considers key supply chain activities including biomass harvesting/processing, transportation, and storage. The model uses the delivered feedstock cost, energy consumption, and GHG emissions as system performance criteria. The utility of the supply chain simulation model is demonstrated by considering a biomass supply chain for a biofuel facility in the lower peninsula of Michigan. The results show that the model is a useful tool for supply chain management, including selection of the optimal biofuel facility location, logistics design, inventory management, and information exchange.},

IBSAL-MC is a hybrid push-pull logistics model which pushes the field operations to harvest and collect as much biomass as possible within the harvest season while pulling downstream operations to meet the daily demand of the ethanol plant. The proposed ethanol plant would be located near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada. Despite the abundance of wheat straw in the region (more than five times the annual demand), the daily demand of the ethanol plant would be fully met for only 104 days. In terms of the total annual demand, only 92\% of it would be met. The logistics cost varies between \$62.06 and \$63.46t−1 with 90\% confidence level. The capacity of the required on-farm storage and at-plant storage are estimated at 400 t and 3500 t of biomass, respectively. Several managerial insights were also given to improve the biomass logistics system in terms of demand fulfilment, logistics costs and resource utilisation.},

	abstract = {Sustainable feedstock harvest strategies are needed to ensure bioenergy production does not irreversibly degrade soil resources. The objective for this study was to document corn (Zea mays L.) grain and stover fraction yields, plant nutrient removal and replacement costs, feedstock quality, soil-test changes, and soil quality indicator response to four stover harvest strategies for continuous corn and a corn-soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] rotation. The treatments included collecting (1) all standing plant material above a stubble height of 10 cm (whole plant), (2) the upper-half by height (ear shank upward), (3) the lower-half by height (from the 10 cm stubble height to just below the earshank), or (4) no removal. Collectable biomass from Treatment 2 averaged 3.9 (+/- 0.8) Mg ha(-1) for continuous corn (2005 through 2009), and 4.8 (+/- 0.4) Mg ha(-1) for the rotated corn (2005, 2007, and 2009). Compared to harvesting only the grain, collecting stover increased the average N-P-K removal by 29, 3 and 34 kg ha(-1) for continuous corn and 42, 3, and 34 kg ha(-1) for rotated corn, respectively. Harvesting the lower-half of the corn plant (Treatment 3) required two passes, resulted in frequent plugging of the combine, and provided a feedstock with low quality for conversion to biofuel. Therefore. Treatment 3 was replaced by a "cobs-only" harvest starting in 2009. Structural sugars glucan and xylan accounted for up to 60\% of the chemical composition, while galactan, arabinan, and mannose constituted less than 5\% of the harvest fractions collected from 2005 through 2008. Soil-test data from samples collected after the first harvest (2005) revealed low to very low plant-available P and K levels which reduced soybean yield in 2006 after harvesting the whole-plant in 2005. Average continuous corn yields were 21\% lower than rotated yields with no significant differences due to stover harvest. Rotated corn yields in 2009 showed some significant differences, presumably because soil-test P was again in the low range. A soil quality analysis using the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) with six indicators showed that soils at the continuous corn and rotated sites were functioning at an average of 93 and 83\% of their inherent potential, respectively. With good crop management practices, including routine soil-testing, adequate fertilization, maintenance of soil organic matter, sustained soil structure, and prevention of wind, water or tillage erosion, a portion of the corn stover being produced in central Iowa, USA can be harvested in a sustainable manner.

	abstract = {Biomass has the potential to create sustainable energy systems, which is critical for societal welfare. A major issue regarding biomass resources is crop residues or leftover biomass that is burnt by farmers after harvesting; this happens due to high transportation costs which make burning the cheapest way to remove the residue. We develop a decision support system using a large-scale linear program with the goal of maximizing profit with and without the emission cost. This system helps identify farms that would benefit society were they to be incentivized under a biomass crop assistance program (BCAP). A case study of leftover corn stover in the state of North Dakota is analyzed to validate the model. Our results reveal that an incentive of \$7.20 per ton of corn stover converted to ethanol when 20\% of rail capacity is allocated is ideal, as it produces the lowest emissions of 16,784,953 metric tons with a \$73,462,599 profit. Furthermore, penalizing emissions resulting from the transportation of corn stover also helps reduce emissions; a suitable value for the penalty could be \$71.7 per metric ton of CO2 emitted. Such a policy would result in reducing dependency on petroleum, thus promoting a sustainable biomass supply chain.},

	abstract = {One of the numerous challenges awaiting Serbia in the process of European integration is the increase in use of renewable sources of energy. The reason for such an increase is not merely a formal acceptance of European goals but the high energy import dependence, a relatively developed agricultural sector, with insufficiently exploited potentials of biomass, accompanied by an ever-growing awareness of the need for establishing long-lasting sustainable development. Serbia has a relatively undeveloped livestock sector which can absorb a limited portion of the biomass produced. Additionally, insufficient awareness on the part of farmers and the preconception of the low cost-effectiveness of biomass utilisation for the purpose of energy production are factors which, unsurprisingly, contribute to the current practice of burning the largest portion of the biomass produced on site, which is economically and ecologically unacceptable. This paper analyses the amounts of biomass available in Serbia and the prospects of its economically viable utilisation. The cost analysis conducted indicates that the energy obtained from small rectangular straw bales (the most widespread way of utilisation), is less costly by 28\%, than the energy obtained from coal, whereas the energy obtained from round bales is cheaper by 34\%. Sensitivity analysis has shown that the results obtained are relatively resistant to price changes in the most important inputs. The sensitivity is higher towards the efficiency of the machinery used; therefore, insistent efforts should be made for creating conditions where the introduction of more up-to-date technical solutions, already existing in developed countries, will become feasible.},

	abstract = {This study assessed the feasibility of mobilising maize and wheat residues for large-scale bioenergy applications in South Africa by establishing sustainable residue removal rates and cost of supply based on different production regions. A key objective was to refine the methodology for estimating crop residue harvesting for bioenergy use, while maintaining soil productivity and avoiding displacement of competing residue uses. At current conditions, the sustainable bioenergy potential from maize and wheat residues was estimated to be about 104 PJ. There is potential to increase the amount of crop residues to 238 PJ through measures such as no till cultivation and adopting improved cropping systems. These estimates were based on minimum residues requirements of 2 t ha−1 for soil erosion control and additional residue amounts to maintain 2\% SOC level. At the farm gate, crop residues cost between 0.9 and 1.7 \$ GJ−1. About 96\% of these residues are available below 1.5 \$ GJ−1. In the improved scenario, up to 85\% of the biomass is below 1.3 \$ GJ−1. For biomass deliveries at the conversion plant, about 36\% is below 5 \$ GJ−1 while in the optimised scenario, about 87\% is delivered below 5\$ GJ−1. Co-firing residues with coal results in lower cost of electricity compared to other renewables and significant GHG (CO2 eq) emissions reduction (up to 0.72 tons MWh−1). Establishing sustainable crop residue supply systems in South Africa could start by utilising the existing agricultural infrastructure to secure supply and develop a functional market. It would then be necessary to incentivise improvements across the value chain.},

	abstract = {Agricultural residues, particularly corn stover, are a promising feedstock for bioenergy systems. To analyze these systems in a life cycle framework, environmental impacts from cultivation and harvest must be allocated to the resulting products, corn grain and stover. This paper explores three approaches to allocation for corn and stover: economic and energy-based allocation, as well as a subdivision approach, which assigns to stover only those additional activities caused by its harvest. This study develops a life cycle inventory for corn production based on average U.S. agronomic data and then applies the three allocation methods to produce a life cycle inventory for stover. This inventory contains over 1100 environmental flows and is available in the online Supplementary material. This analysis shows that economic allocation and subdivision assign the least impact to stover (14–15\%), energy-based allocation the most (30\%). One hectare of corn and stover production emits approximately 2.5 tonnes of carbon equivalent and requires approximately 23 GJ of fossil energy. Value-based allocation methods, like energy and economic allocation, may be most appropriate when they reflect the goals of the production system. In addition, value-based methods are typically simple to apply, and thus may be more transparent for those interpreting a study. Subdivision, as applied in this study, reflects the consequences of changing the existing corn production systems, may require more data, and might be most appropriate for near-term prospective analyses; such as those that question whether adding cellulosic ethanol production to existing corn production systems yields environmental benefits. Thus, the selection of an allocation approach should hinge on the intent of the study.},

This study applied Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools to estimate the Net Energy Gain (NEG) and Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI) for different biomass/bioenergy production activities in rural areas. The focus was on those activities that are least damaging or even socially, environmentally or economically beneficial. We considered bioenergy production from crop residues, manure, and grass in natural grasslands and surplus pasturelands. The feasibility and vulnerability of different sources was assessed within the context of existing policy constraints, and the potential contribution to the EU's bioenergy targets was evaluated. Taking the Overijssel province in the Netherlands as a case study, we showed that 66.01 PJ can be contributed from by-products, with an additional 3.34 TJ coming from more conventional pasturelands. The NEG from biogas can potentially take care of Overijssel's entire renewable energy target for the year 2030. When producing bioenergy from by-products, the EROEI is quite high (7–17), indicating that there is a big potential for by-products to provide energy without compromising the ecological or agricultural functions of the landscapes. However there are still many changes in the practices, technologies and policies associated with bioenergy production that have to be made to harvest this potential energy resource.},

	abstract = {The power cost and optimum plant size for power plants using three biomass fuels in western Canada were determined. The three fuels are biomass from agricultural residues (grain straw), whole boreal forest, and forest harvest residues from existing lumber and pulp operations (limbs and tops). Forest harvest residues have the smallest economic size, 137 MW, and the highest power cost, \$63.00MWh−1 (Year 2000 US\$). The optimum size for agricultural residues is 450MW (the largest single biomass unit judged feasible in this study), and the power cost is \$50.30MWh−1. If a larger biomass boiler could be built, the optimum project size for straw would be 628MW. Whole forest harvesting has an optimum size of 900MW (two maximum sized units), and a power cost of \$47.16MWh−1 without nutrient replacement. However, power cost versus size from whole forest is essentially flat from 450MW(\$47.76MWh−1) to 3150MW(\$48.86MWh−1), so the optimum size is better thought of as a wide range. None of these projects are economic today, but could become so with a greenhouse gas credit. All biomass cases show some flatness in the profile of power cost vs. plant capacity. This occurs because the reduction in capital cost per unit capacity with increasing capacity is offset by increasing biomass transportation cost as the area from which biomass is drawn increases. This in turn means that smaller than optimum plants can be built with only a minor cost penalty. Both the yield of biomass per unit area and the location of the biomass have an impact on power cost and optimum size. Agricultural and forest harvest residues are transported over existing road networks, whereas the whole forest harvest requires new roads and has a location remote from existing transmission lines. Nutrient replacement in the whole forest case would make power from the forest comparable in cost to power from straw.},

A model was defined to estimate the cost of trash recovery, simulating the field capacity, oil consumption, depreciation, repair and maintenance as well as labor required for the field and transport operations. Six recovery systems were studied both from the technical and economical points of view. The results showed that handling billets and trash together, described as "Integral harvesting", has the lowest cost for trash recovery, both for short and long distances, followed by bulk handling of chopped trash, the round bale, the cotton bale and finally the pellet and briquette systems.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the economics, energy inputs, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for a proposed “field to facility” corn stover logistics system. The system included collection and transport by round bales to local storages within 3.2 km (2 mile) of the field during the fall harvest period followed by processing at the local storage sites throughout the year using mobile units which converted the bales to bulk material by tub‐grinding and roll‐press compacting to 240 kg/m3 (15 lb/ft3) to achieve 22.7‐t (25‐ton) loads for truck delivery to an end user within a 48‐km (30‐mile) radius. The total cost and fossil energy consumption for delivering the bulk corn stover (15\% moisture) to end users were \$81/t (\$74/ton) and 936 MJ/t, respectively. The total fossil energy consumption was equivalent to approximately 7\% of the energy content of corn stover. The life‐cycle GHG emission for heat and power applications was approximately 114 kg CO2e/t at 15\% moisture or 8 g CO2e/MJ of dry matter including emissions for logistics and combustion, but excluding those associated with soil organic carbon (SOC) loss. Our estimates show that as a fuel for heat and power applications, corn stover reduced life‐cycle GHG emissions by factors of approximately 8 and 14 compared to natural gas and coal, respectively.},

	abstract = {A simulation was done to compare harvest costs for large round bales (1·8 m diameter × 1·5 m wide) vs large square bales (1 m high × 1·2 m wide × 2·4 m long). Assumptions were made to give each system an idealized opportunity to harvest switchgrass yields of 4·5, 9 and 18 dry Mg/ha. Using the round bale, total harvest costs (mow-condition, rake, bale and move to an on-farm storage location) were \$17·00, \$15·90 and \$19·15/dry Mg, respectively. For the square bale, they were \$13·40, \$12·25 and \$11·95/dry Mg, respectively. Density of hay in the windrow affected the performance of the round baler; heavier windrows produced lower density bales, thus harvest cost increased as yield doubled from 9 to 18 dry Mg/ha. Comparing at 9 Mg/ha yield, harvest cost was 23\% less for the square bale. The square bales must be stored in covered storage (\$14·16/dry-Mg-delivered annual storage cost to achieve 3\% storage/handling loss), while net-wrapped round bales can be stored outside on crushed rock (\$3·20/dry-Mg-delivered annual storage cost to achieve 5\% storage/handling loss). Total harvest plus storage costs, per-dry-Mg delivered basis, were \$20 for the round bale and \$27 for the square bale. Because of the requirement for covered storage, the square bale will have more difficulty competing economically with the round bale in the southeastern United States. However, as yield increases above 9 dry Mg/ha and storage losses for round bales stored outside increase above 5\%, the difference in cost decreases.},

	abstract = {The economic feasibility of biomass based combustion projects of various capacities to generate electricity from rice straw is evaluated for Thailand. For an assumed lifespan of 20years, rice straw-fueled combustion facilities would generate Net Present Values (NPV) of −3.15, 0.94, 2.96, 9.33, and 18.79 million USD for projected 5, 8, 10, 15, and 20MWe plants, respectively. Examining the effects of scale on the cost of generated electricity (COE) over the considered range of capacities indicates that COE varies from 0.0676USD/kWh at 20MWe to 0.0899USD/kWh at 5MWe. By scaling up the power plants, the variations of the financial parameters, namely NPV values, become less sensitive to the critical variables. As an example, if the fuel price, selling price of electricity, and the plant factor change by +36\% (31.0USD/t), −16\% (0.0758USD/kWh), and −14\% (5650h/yr), respectively, the largest scale project is still appealing for investment. Nevertheless, to ensure a secure fuel supply, smaller scale power plants, i.e., 8 and 10MWe may be more practicable. A further sensitivity analysis is discussed in terms of the financial feasibility of the projects (i.e., NPV⩾0), and the investment appraisal condition (here, Internal Rate of Return or IRR⩾11\%).},

This paper presents a simple and detailed method for estimating the cost of straw-based power generation with life cycle analysis, and identifies the main causes for the financial deficit of these plants through a sensitivity analysis and survey. It concludes that: (i) compared with coal-fired power generation, the cost of straw-based power generation is indeed high. (ii) The fuel cost takes the largest share in the operation cost. (iii) The basic causes of the high cost are from straw characteristics, mismatch between demand and supply, immature technology, inappropriate project planning and low motivation of farmer selling straw. Based on the basic causes, we propose the countermeasures.},

In addition to meeting renewable energy goals, use of corn stover for energy production may provide a new source of income for corn growers. This study estimates the costs of corn stover harvest and supply, and then uses that information to estimate farm production decisions and changes to farm profit at varying corn stover prices. In this study, corn stover is collected in large round bales using a raking, baling, and staging method. Harvest cost includes payments for fuel, labor, equipment ownership and repair, net wrap, and nutrient replacement. Supply costs include storage, loading and unloading, and transport. The total cost of harvest and supply is estimated between 82.19 \$ Mg−1 (dry) and 100.56 \$ Mg−1 (dry). Costs will vary considerably from farm to farm and from year to year depending on weather conditions. A linear programming model was used to estimate the willingness of corn growers to harvest corn stover at varying stover prices. Corn stover supply, farm profit, and land allocation was analyzed under multiple scenarios. At a price of 88.19 \$ Mg−1, farms in the base case harvested corn stover at a rate of 2.49 Mg ha−1 using a 33\% removal rate. At this price, stover provided enough additional profit to entice farmers to shift to more continuous corn production. Future research is needed to determine the overall impacts of a viable stover market on corn and soybean production and price.},

	abstract = {Almost 36 million tonnes (t) of cereal grains are harvested annually on more than 16 million hectares (ha) on the Canadian prairies. The net straw production varies year by year depending upon weather patterns, crop fertility, soil conservation measures, harvest method, and plant variety. The net yield of straw, after discountinng for soil conservation, averages approximately 2.5 dry (d)t ha-1. Efficient equipment is needed to collect and package the material as a feedstock for industrial applications. This paper investigates the costs, energy input, and emissions from power equipment used for harvesting straw. Five scenarios were investigated: (1) large square bales, (2) round bales, (3) large compacted stacks (loafs), (4) dried chops, and (5) wet chops. The baled or loafed biomass is stacked next to the farm. Dry chop is collected in a large pile and wet chop is ensiled. The baling and stacking cost was \$21.47 dt-1 (dry tonne), with little difference between round and large square baling. Loafing was the cheapest option at \$17.08 dt-1. Dry chop and piling was \$23.90 dt-1 and wet chop followed by ensiling was \$59.75 dt-1. A significant portion of the wet chop cost was in ensiling. Energy input and emissions were proportional to the costs for each system, except for loafing, which required more energy input than the baling systems. As a fraction of the energy content of biomass (roughly 16 GJ dt-1), the energy input ranged from 1.2\% for baling to 3.2\% for ensiling. Emissions from the power equipment ranged from 20.3 kg CO2e dt-1 to more than 40 kg CO2e dt-1. A sensitivity analysis on the effect of yield on collection costs showed that a 33\% increase in yield reduced the cost by 20\%. Similarly a sensitivity analysis on weather conditions showed that a 10°C cooler climate extended the harvest period by 5-10 days whereas a 10°C warmer climate shortened the harvest period by 2-3 days.

	abstract = {Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a promising cellulosic biomass feedstock for biorefineries and biofuel production. This paper reviews current and future potential technologies for production, harvest, storage, and transportation of switchgrass. Our analysis indicates that for a yield of 10 Mg ha−1, the current cost of producing switchgrass (after establishment) is about \$41.50 Mg−1. The costs may be reduced to about half this if the yield is increased to 30 Mg ha−1 through genetic improvement, intensive crop management, and/or optimized inputs. At a yield of 10 Mg ha−1, we estimate that harvesting costs range from \$23.72 Mg−1 for current baling technology to less than \$16 Mg−1 when using a loafing collection system. At yields of 20 and 30 Mg ha−1 with an improved loafing system, harvesting costs are even lower at \$12.75 Mg−1 and \$9.59 Mg−1, respectively. Transport costs vary depending upon yield and fraction of land under switchgrass, bulk density of biomass, and total annual demand of a biorefinery. For a 2000 Mg d−1 plant and an annual yield of 10 Mg ha−1, the transport cost is an estimated \$15.42 Mg−1, assuming 25\% of the land is under switchgrass production. Total delivered cost of switchgrass using current baling technology is \$80.64 Mg−1, requiring an energy input of 8.5\% of the feedstock higher heating value (HHV). With mature technology, for example, a large, loaf-collection system, the total delivered cost is reduced to about \$71.16 Mg−1 with 7.8\% of the feedstock HHV required as input. Further cost reduction can be achieved by combining mature technology with increased crop productivity. Delivered cost and energy input do not vary significantly as biorefinery capacity increases from 2000 Mg d−1 to 5000 Mg d−1 because the cost of increased distance to access a larger volume feedstock offsets the gains in increased biorefinery capacity. This paper outlines possible scenarios for the expansion of switchgrass handling to 30 Tg (million Mg) in 2015 and 100 Tg in 2030 based on predicted growth of the biorefinery industry in the USA. The value of switchgrass collection operations is estimated at more than \$0.6 billion in 2015 and more than \$2.1 billion in 2030. The estimated value of post-harvest operations is \$0.6–\$2.0 billion in 2015, and \$2.0–\$6.5 billion in 2030, depending on the degree of preprocessing. The need for power equipment (tractors) will increase from 100 MW in 2015 to 666 MW in 2030, with corresponding annual values of \$150 and \$520 million, respectively. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

Among the three varieties NIAB-111 showed maximum fiber strength, fiber fineness and fiber elongation followed by CIM-496, whereas FH-901 found to have low fiber strength, fiber fineness and fiber elongation and 120 kg N ha-1 was proved to be the best nitrogen level for obtaining higher yield and lint percentage.},

	abstract = {In co-operation with a Dutch company (NV Afvalzorg) and the Dutch agency for energy and environment (Novem), ECN has successfully tested 10 different biomass residues in its 500kWth circulating fluidized-bed gasification facility. Among the fuels used are demolition wood (both pure and mixed with sewage sludge and paper sludge), verge grass, railroad ties, cacao shells and different woody fuels. Railroad ties turn out to contain very little (heavy) metals. Initially, fuel feeding problems often impeded smooth operation. Contrary to feeding systems, the circulating fluidized-bed gasification process itself seems very flexible concerning the conversion of different kinds of biomass fuels. The fuel moisture content is one of the most important fuel characteristics. More moisture means that more air is needed to maintain the process temperature resulting in better carbon conversion and lower tar emission but also lower product gas heating value and lower cold gas efficiency. So, for a good comparison of the gasification behaviour of different fuels, the moisture content should be similar. However, the moisture content should be defined on an ash-free basis rather than on total mass (the usual way). Some of the ashes produced and retained in the second cyclone were analysed both for elemental composition and leaching behaviour. It turned out that the leaching rate of Mo and Br, elements only present in small concentrations, are preventing the ash to be considered as inert material according to the Dutch legislation for dumping on landfill sites.},

	abstract = {The straws of two high-biomass soybean lines developed at ARS for bioenergy were subjected to thermochemical conversion by fast pyrolysis. The objective was to evaluate the potential use of the straw for the production of liquid fuel intermediates. The immediate goal was to demonstrate production of pyrolysis liquid that can be burned “as is” and/or potentially be upgraded to transportation grade fuel and at the same time produce biochar that can be deployed as a soil amendment. The goal supports the concept of on-farm biorefinery where food and bioenergy can be sustainably produced in a soybean farm system. The study shows that high yields of pyrolysis liquids (biooil) can be efficiently produced from the soybean straws using the fluidized-bed fast pyrolysis technology. Free flowing biooils with heating values in excess of 20 MJ/kg were produced in yields of approximately 70 wt \%. Accompanying this was 22 wt \% mineral-rich biochar that can be returned to the soil and up to 10 wt \% combustible gas with the potential to partially power the pyrolysis system. A sustainable farm system may be enhanced by the synergy between production of extra biomass in soybean cultivation, lignocellulosic biofuel production, production and use of carbon sequestering, soil-amending biochar in addition to nitrogen fixation by rhizobial bacteria. Although the findings are encouraging, actual data over several years will be necessary to fully evaluate a potential soybean farm biorefinery system by comprehensive life-cycle analysis. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2010},

	abstract = {Production of biochar from slow pyrolysis of biomass is a promising carbon negative procedure since it removes the net carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and produce recalcitrant carbon suitable for sequestration in soil. Biochar production can vary significantly with the pyrolysis parameter. This study investigated the impact of temperature and heating rate on the yield and properties of biochar derived from cassava plantations residues which are cassava stem (CS) and cassava rhizome (CR). The pyrolysis temperatures ranged from 400°C to 600°C while the heating rate parameter was varied from 5°C/min to 25°C/min. The experiment was conducted using the lab scale slow pyrolysis system. The increment of temperature and heating rate of slow pyrolysis for both cassava wastes had raised the fixed carbon content of the biochar but decreased the biochar yield. More biochar was produced at lower temperature and lower heating rate. Temperature gave more influence on the biochar yield as compared to the heating rate parameter. The highest biochar yield of more than 35 mf wt. \% can be obtained from both CS and CR at 400°C and heating rate of 5°C/min. From the proximate analysis, the results showed that cassava wastes contain high percentage of volatile matter which is more than 80 mf wt. \%. Meanwhile, the biochar produced from cassava wastes contain high percentage of fixed carbon which is about 5−8 times higher than their raw samples. This suggested that, it is a good step to convert CS and CR into high carbon biochar via slow pyrolysis process that can substantially yield more biochar, up to 37 mf wt. \% in this study. Since the fixed carbon content for both CS and CR biochar produced in any studied parameter were found to be more than 75 mf wt. \%, it is suggested that biochar from cassava wastes is suitable for carbon sequestration.},

Considering these high-value applications, char could provide economic benefits to a biorefinery utilizing gasification or pyrolysis technologies. However, the properties of char depend heavily on biomass feedstock, gasifier design and operating conditions. This paper reports the effects of biomass type (switchgrass, sorghum straw and red cedar) and equivalence ratio (0.20, 0.25 and 0.28), i.e., the ratio of air supply relative to the air that is required for stoichiometric combustion of biomass, on the physiochemical properties of char derived from gasification. Results show that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of most of the char were 1-10 m(2)/g and increased as the equivalence ratio increased. Char moisture and fixed carbon contents decreased while ash content increased as equivalence ratio increased. The corresponding Fourier Transform Infrared spectra showed that the surface functional groups of char differed between biomass types but remained similar with change in equivalence ratio.},

	abstract = {Biochar is the porous, carbonaceous material produced by thermochemical treatment of organic materials in an oxygen-limited environment. In general, most biochar can be considered resistant to chemical and biological decomposition, and therefore suitable for carbon (C) sequestration. However, to assess the C sequestration potential of different types of biochar, a reliable determination of their stability is needed. Several techniques for assessing biochar stability have been proposed, e.g. proximate analysis, oxygen (O): C ratio and hydrogen (H): C ratio; however, none of them are yet widely recognized nor validated for this purpose. Biochar produced from three feedstocks (Pine, Rice husk and Wheat straw) at four temperatures (350, 450, 550 and 650 °C) and two heating rates (5 and 100 °C min−1) was analysed using three methods of stability determination: proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and a new analytical tool developed at the UK Biochar Research Centre known as the Edinburgh accelerated ageing tool (Edinburgh stability tool). As expected, increased pyrolysis temperatures resulted in higher fractions of stable C and total C due to an increased release of volatiles. Data from the Edinburgh stability tool were compared with those obtained by the other methods, i.e. fixed C, volatile matter, O : C and H : C ratios, to investigate potential relationships between them. Results of this comparison showed that there was a strong correlation (R {\textgreater} 0.79) between the stable C determined by the Edinburgh stability tool and fixed C, volatile matter and O : C, however, H : C showed a weaker correlation (R = 0.65). An understanding of the influence of feedstock and production conditions on the long-term stability of biochar is pivotal for its function as a C mitigation measure, as production and use of unstable biochar would result in a relatively rapid return of C into the atmosphere, thus potentially intensifying climate change rather than alleviating it.},

The understanding of its chemical and physical properties, which are strongly related to the type of the initial material used and pyrolysis conditions, is crucial to identify the most suitable application of biochar in soil. A selection of organic wastes with different characteristics (e.g., rice husk (RH), rice straw (RS), wood chips of apple tree (Malus pumila) (AB), and oak tree (Quercus serrata) (OB)) were pyrolyzed at different temperatures (400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 ◦C) in order to optimize the physicochemical properties of biochar as a soil amendment. Low-temperature pyrolysis produced high biochar yields; in contrast, high-temperature pyrolysis led to biochars with a high C content, large surface area, and high adsorption characteristics. Biochar obtained at 600 ◦C leads to a high recalcitrant character, whereas that obtained at 400 ◦C retains volatile and easily labile compounds. The biochar obtained from rice materials (RH and RS) showed a high yield and unique chemical properties because of the incorporation of silica elements into its chemical structure. The biochar obtained from wood materials (AB and OB) showed high carbon content and a high absorption character.},

	abstract = {Large-scale bioenergy demand has triggered new approaches to straw management in Brazilian sugarcane fields. With the progressive shift from a burned to a nonburned harvest system, most of the straw presently retained on the soil surface has become economically viable feedstock for bioenergy production. The trade-offs between the need to preserve soil quality and produce more bioenergy have been the subject of intense discussion. This study presents a synthesis of available information on the magnitude of the main impacts of straw removal from sugarcane fields for bioenergy production and therefore represents an easily available resource to guide management decisions on the recommended amount of straw to be maintained on the field to take advantage of the agronomic, environmental, and industrial benefits. Crop residues remaining on sugarcane fields provide numerous ecosystem services including nutrient recycling, soil biodiversity, water storage, carbon accumulation, control of soil erosion, and weed infestation. Furthermore, several studies reported higher sugarcane production under straw retention on the field, while few suggest that straw may jeopardize biomass production in cold regions and under some specific soil conditions. Pest control is among the parameters favored by straw removal, while N2O emissions are increased only if straw is associated with the application of N fertilizer and vinasse. An appropriate recommendation, which is clearly site specific, should be based on a minimum mass of straw on the field to provide those benefits. Overall, this review indicates that most of the agronomic and environmental benefits are achieved when at least 7 Mg ha−1 of dry straw is maintained on the soil surface. However, modeling efforts are of paramount importance to assess the magnitude and rates of straw removal considering the several indicators involved in this complex equation, so that an accurate straw recovery rate could be provided to producers and industry toward greater sustainability.},

In her work with economic experiments, Ostrom was able to replicate important findings that gave support to case studies from IFRI and CIPEC. She showed that panaceas did not exist for resource management challenges. Ostrom's work showed the value of building multinational, multidisciplinary, and comparative research bridging the social and natural sciences and the complexity of governance systems.

This relationship holds even when the influence of a number of other factors such as user group size, subsistence, and commercial importance of forests, size of forest, and collective action for forest improvement activities is taken into account. Although several of the above factors have a statistically significant relationship to changes in the condition of forest commons, differences in levels of local enforcement strongly moderate their link with forest commons outcomes.

This article draws on research by scholars in the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) research network which demonstrates that some forms of heterogeneity do not negatively affect some forms of collective action. More importantly, IFRI research draws out the interrelations among group size, heterogeneity, and institutions. Institutions can affect the level of heterogeneity or compensate for it. Group size appears to have a non-linear relationship to at least some forms of collective action. Moreover, group size may be as much an indicator of institutional success as a precondition for such success.},

While the net effect of leadership on the trade-off in forestry outcomes is significant, there are multiple causal paths via which various factors influence the trade-off in forestry outcomes. Some of these paths take place in the presence of leadership, while the presence or the absence of leadership is irrelevant for the rest of the paths. This finding indicates that leaders often play an important role in the decisionmaking process during the governance of forests, especially when hard decisions need to be taken.},

Current studies of local resource management examine many factors thought to be associated with good resource conditions. Despite the number of studies and the importance of such resources to millions of people worldwide, a lack of theory and hypothesis testing beyond the case level limits the lessons empirical studies offer. We argue that regular monitoring and sanctioning of rules—rule enforcement—is a necessary condition for successful resource management. We test our theory using data regarding 178 user groups and by pairing rule enforcement with other important factors: social capital, formal organization, and dependence on forest products.},

Are parks effective in forest conservation? This study examines data from 163 forests in 13 countries to determine the necessity of legally established protected areas for forest conservation and alternative conditions and institutions that may conserve forests. The results show no statistically significant differences in forest conditions between legally protected forests and forests governed by users who establish and recognize forest rules. Furthermore, higher levels of vegetation density and significantly more forest rules exist in areas not legally protected. The dearth of rules in protected areas suggests that parks may not be the optimal governance structure for promoting local conservation.},

A recognized weakness of this approach relates to the fact that results cannot easily be extrapolated. For my analysis, I use a large-N, cross-national dataset instead. What constitutes an effective local forest governance regime? I show that especially monitoring – and to a lesser extent, maintenance – is correlated with improving forest conditions. When are effective governance regimes likely to emerge? I show that social capital, organization, leadership and autonomy contribute to the development of institutions for collective action.

Using statistical analysis of 326 forest user groups from 13 countries in the database of the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) program, the effects on user group rankings of forest conditions are estimated with a probability model. Overall, the results indicate that user groups with more complete property rights are more likely to rank forest conditions favorably.

Elinor Ostrom



Born in Los Angeles in 1933, Elinor Ostrom experienced firsthand the value of sustainability at a young age. She grew up in an era of economic depression that led into a resource-consuming war, in a city where fresh water was a prized commodity. “My mother had a victory garden during the war,” she recalls, “so I learned all about growing vegetables and preserving them by canning, and that was a wonderful experience that a lot of urban kids don't ever learn.” These early real-world lessons also revealed another important fact of life to Ostrom: that most people, when presented with a resource problem, can cooperate and act for the common good.

Ostrom, the Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science at Indiana University (Bloomington, IN) and cofounder and codirector of Indiana University's Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, has studied how self-organization and local-level management works to keep common resources, whether natural (e.g., forests) or man-made (e.g., police forces), viable. Combining data from diverse sources ranging from classical techniques such as surveys to modern advances such as satellite imagery, Ostrom has uncovered numerous principles that govern successful sustainability and that defy conventional beliefs

Elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2001 and a member of the PNAS Editorial Board, Ostrom discusses her insights for effective forest management in her Inaugural Article in this issue of PNAS (1). From the Amazon basin to the Arctic Circle, forests provide an abundance of resources (timber, fuel, minerals, food, and tourism) yet face rapid depletion. Using social and ecological measurements in conjunction with computational predictions of human decision-making, Ostrom highlights the conditions that allow for the most productive tenure arrangements, but she stresses that no single governance policy can control overharvesting in all settings.

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that coupled socio-ecological dynamics can be qualitatively different from the dynamics of social or ecological systems in isolation from one another. The influence of the type of ecological dynamics on the dynamics of the larger socio-ecological system is less well studied, however. Here, we carry out such a comparison using a mathematical model of a common pool resource problem. A population must make decisions about harvesting a renewable resource. Individuals may either be cooperators, who harvest at a sustainable level, or defectors, who overharvest. Cooperators punish defectors through social ostracism. Individuals can switch strategies according to the costs and benefits of harvesting and the strength of social ostracism. These mechanisms are represented by a differential equation for social dynamics, which is coupled to three different types of resource dynamics: logistic growth, constant inflow, and threshold growth. We find that when human influence is sufficiently weak, the form of resource dynamics leaves a strong imprint on the socio-ecological dynamics, and human social dynamics are qualitatively very different from resource dynamics. However, stronger human influence introduces a broad intermediate parameter regime where dynamical patterns converge to a common type: the three types of ecological systems exhibit similar dynamics, but also, social and ecological dynamics mirror one another. This regime of strong human influence includes generation of stable limit cycles at high rates of social learning. Such oscillations are a consequence of stronger coupling and are reminiscent of synchrony in other fields, such as the classic problem of coupled oscillators. Socio-ecological convergence has implications for how we understand and manage complex socio-ecological systems. In an era of growing human influence on ecological systems, further empirical and theoretical work is required to determine whether socio-ecological convergence is present in real systems.},

Nevertheless, real individuals are not helplessly trapped in this dilemma and are often able to sustainably manage their commons by building endogenous institutions. This paper proposes both a simple analytical model and a more complex agent-based one designed to study common-pool resource management problems with a specific focus on the relation between agents’ beliefs and institutions. The conditions where agents are allowed to build management institutions lead to much better outcomes than the ones where agents can only rely on individual beliefs in order to limit the resource consumption. This happens despite the fact that agents act in a competitive environment favoring high resource consumers.},

Local interactions give rise to global dynamics. These models can be thought of as in silico laboratories that can be used to investigate the system being modeled. Optimization problems for agent-based models are problems concerning the optimal way of steering a particular model to a desired state. Given that agent-based models have no rigorous mathematical formulation, standard analysis is difficult, and traditional mathematical approaches are often intractable. 
 
This work presents techniques for the analysis of agent-based models and for solving optimization problems with such models. Techniques include model reduction, simulation optimization, conversion to systems of discrete difference equations, and a variety of heuristic methods. The proposed strategies are novel in their application; results show that for a large class of models, these strategies are more effective than existing methods.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems can be modeled as multiagent systems in which the constituent entities (agents) interact with each other. The global dynamics of such a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the agents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems, they are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations can be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally validate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical framework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally establish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known mathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one such framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic and stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a sampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite dynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties of multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a universal model for computation.},

Since there is currently no agreed-upon standard way to specify such models, it is not always easy to use published models. Also, since model descriptions are not usually given in mathematical terms, it is difficult to bring mathematical analysis tools to bear, so that models are typically studied through simulation. In order to address this issue, Grimm et al. proposed a protocol for model specification, the so-called ODD protocol, which provides a standard way to describe models. This paper proposes an addition to the ODD protocol which allows the description of an agent-based model as a dynamical system, which provides access to computational and theoretical tools for its analysis. The mathematical framework is that of algebraic models, that is, time-discrete dynamical systems with algebraic structure. It is shown by way of several examples how this mathematical specification can help with model analysis. This mathematical framework can also accommodate other model types such as Boolean networks and the more general logical models, as well as Petri nets.},

Recently, equation-free (EF) methods have been developed to extend numerical continuation techniques to systems where the dynamics are described at a microscopic scale and continuation of a macroscopic property of the system is considered. To date, the practical use of EF methods has been limited by; (1) the over-head of application-specific implementation; (2) the laborious configuration of problem-specific parameters; and (3) large ensemble sizes (potentially) leading to computationally restrictive run-times.},

The choice of a suitable indicator quantifying the distance between the model and the data is pivotal to model selection. However, how to validate and discriminate between alternative models is still an open problem calling for further investigation, especially in light of the increasing use of simulations in social sciences. In this paper, we present an information theoretic criterion to measure how close models' synthetic output replicates the properties of observable time series without the need to resort to any likelihood function or to impose stationarity requirements. The indicator is sufficiently general to be applied to any kind of model able to simulate or predict time series data, from simple univariate models such as Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) and Markov processes to more complex objects including agent-based or dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. More specifically, we use a simple function of the L-divergence computed at different block lengths in order to select the model that is better able to reproduce the distributions of time changes in the data. To evaluate the L-divergence, probabilities are estimated across frequencies including a correction for the systematic bias. Finally, using a known data generating process, we show how this indicator can be used to validate and discriminate between different models providing a precise measure of the distance between each of them and the data.},

Our model is a stylized representation of a dynamic population of agents moving and harvesting a renewable resource. Cooperators (agents who harvest an amount close to the maximum sustainable yield) and selfish agents (those who harvest an amount greater than the sustainable yield) are simulated in the model. Three indicators of the outcomes of the system are analyzed: the number of settlements, the resource level, and the proportion of cooperators in the population. Our paper adds a more realistic approach to previous studies on the evolution of cooperation by considering a social–ecological system in which agents move in a landscape to harvest a renewable resource. Our results conclude that resource dynamics play an important role when studying levels of cooperation and resource use. Our simulations show that the agents’ mobility significantly affects the outcomes of the system. This response is nonlinear and very sensible to the type of spatial distribution of the resource richness. In our simulations, better outcomes of long-term sustainability of the resource are obtained with moderate agent mobility and cooperation is enhanced in harsh environments with low resource level in which cooperative groups have natural boundaries fostered by agents’ low mobility.},

Much of this research has focused on how different kinds of institutions shape the incentives of users who rely on a common-pool resource system for a variety of their needs. In the process, this body of work has greatly advanced knowledge about how organizations and their rules for managing resources can be designed to improve sustainable resource governance. A significant puzzle that has occupied the scholarship on the commons concerns (1) the differences between formally designed and introduced institutions vs. self-organized informal network norms, and 2) the effects of these differences on resources and governance outcomes. This paper analyzes the different effects of informal norms and formal organizations and their rules through an agent-based model. We examine a model of villagers who choose levels of forest consumption based on the information they derive from social interactions with their neighbors (an informal network with two-way flow of information) and an organization that announces prescribed limits on forest product extraction. The paper investigates how changes in the relative dependence of users on information from formal rules vs. informal norms, and the structure of their social networks affect user behavior, harvesting levels, and forest-related outcomes.},

The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

Based on a worldwide database of CPR groups, Ostrom proposed a set of principles that broadly captured the essential aspects of the institutional arrangements that succeeded, as contrasted to groups whose efforts failed. These principles can be generalized in two respects: first, by showing how they follow from foundational evolutionary principles; and second, by showing how they apply to a wider range of groups. The generality of the core design principles enables them to be used as a practical guide for improving the efficacy of many kinds of groups.},

It can also have profound regional and global consequences by contributing to biodiversity loss, erosion, floods, lowered water tables, and climate change. People and Forests explores the complex interactions between local communities and their forests. It focuses on the rules by which communities govern and manage their forest resources. As part of the International Forestry Resources and Institutions research program, each of the contributors employs the same systematic, comparative, and interdisciplinary methods to examine why some people use their forests sustainably while others do not. The case studies come from fieldwork in Bolivia, Ecuador, India, Nepal, and Uganda. People and Forests offers policymakers a sophisticated view of local forest management from which to develop policy options and offers biophysical and social scientists a better understanding of the linkages between residents, local institutions, and forests.ContributorsArun Agrawal, Abwoli Y.

	abstract = {When is it better to use agent-based (AB) models, and when should differential equation (DE) models be used? Whereas DE models assume homogeneity and perfect mixing within compartments, AB models can capture heterogeneity across individuals and in the network of interactions among them. AB models relax aggregation assumptions, but entail computational and cognitive costs that may limit sensitivity analysis and model scope. Because resources are limited, the costs and benefits of such disaggregation should guide the choice of models for policy analysis. Using contagious disease as an example, we contrast the dynamics of a stochastic AB model with those of the analogous deterministic compartment DE model. We examine the impact of individual heterogeneity and different network topologies, including fully connected, random, Watts-Strogatz small world, scale-free, and lattice networks. Obviously, deterministic models yield a single trajectory for each parameter set, while stochastic models yield a distribution of outcomes. More interestingly, the DE and mean AB dynamics differ for several metrics relevant to public health, including diffusion speed, peak load on health services infrastructure, and total disease burden. The response of the models to policies can also differ even when their base case behavior is similar. In some conditions, however, these differences in means are small compared to variability caused by stochastic events, parameter uncertainty, and model boundary. We discuss implications for the choice among model types, focusing on policy design. The results apply beyond epidemiology: from innovation adoption to financial panics, many important social phenomena involve analogous processes of diffusion and social contagion.},

	abstract = {Cooperation amongst resource users holds the key to overcoming the social dilemma that characterizes community-based common-pool resource management. But is cooperation alone enough to achieve sustainable resource use? The short answer is no. Developing management strategies in a complex social-ecological environment also requires ecological knowledge and approaches to deal with perceived environmental uncertainty. Recent behavioral experimental research indicates variation in the degree to which a group of users can identify a sustainable exploitation level. In this paper, we identify social-ecological micro-foundations that facilitate cooperative sustainable common-pool resource use. We do so by using an agent-based model (ABM) that is informed by behavioral common-pool resource experiments. In these experiments, groups that cooperate do not necessarily manage the resource sustainably, but also over- or underexploit. By reproducing the patterns of the behavioral experiments in a qualitative way, the ABM represents a social-ecological explanation for the experimental observations. We find that the ecological knowledge of each group member cannot sufficiently explain the relationship between cooperation and sustainable resource use. Instead, the development of a sustainable exploitation level depends on the distribution of ecological knowledge among the group members, their influence on each other’s knowledge, and the environmental uncertainty the individuals perceive. The study provides insights about critical social-ecological micro-foundations underpinning collective action and sustainable resource management. These insights may inform policy-making, but also point to future research needs regarding the mechanisms of social learning, the development of shared management strategies and the interplay of social and ecological uncertainty.},

We present in this chapter an overview of ABM; the main features of an agent-based model are given, along with a discussion of what constitutes an agent-based model. The distinction between cellular automata (CA), microsimulation (MSM) and agent-based models are discussed along with the advantages and limitations of ABM for modelling geographical systems.

Whereas prior research attributes this gender gap in sustainable consumption to personality differences between the sexes, we propose that it may also partially stem from a prevalent association between green behavior and femininity, and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are more feminine. Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned than women with gender-identity maintenance, we argue that this greenfeminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine. Further, men's willingness to engage in green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their masculinity, as well as by using masculine rather than conventional green branding. Together, these findings bridge literatures on identity and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to the green-feminine stereotype, genderidentity maintenance can influence men's likelihood of adopting green behaviors.},

After discussing briefly the major findings and accomplishments of the scholarship on the commons, the paper pursues two strategies of critique. The first strategy of friendly critique accepts the basic assumptions of most writings on common property to show that scholars of commons have discovered far more variables that potentially affect resource management than is possible to analyze carefully. The paper identifies some potential means to address the problem of too many variables. The second line of critique proceeds differently. It asks how analyses of common property might change, and what they need to consider, if they loosen assumptions about sovereign selves and apolitical property rights institutions. My examination of these questions concludes this review with an emphasis on the need to (a) attend more carefully to processes of subject formation, and (b) investigate common property arrangements and associated subject positions with greater historical depth.},

Fishery resources are unusual in the fact of their common-property nature; but they are not unique, and similar problems are encountered in other cases of common-property resource industries, such as petroleum production, hunting and trapping, etc. Although the theory presented in the following pages is worked out in terms of the fishing industry, it is, I believe, applicable generally to all cases where natural resources are owned in common and exploited under conditions of individualistic competition.},

	abstract = {The Political Psychology of Women in U.S. Politics is a comprehensive resource for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in women and politics. Highly original and drawing from the best available research in psychology and political science, this book is designed to summarize and extend interdisciplinary research that addresses how and why men and women differ as citizens, as political candidates, and as officeholders. The chapters in this volume are focused on differences in the political behavior and perceptions of men and women, yet the chapters also speak to broader topics within American politics – including political socialization, opinion formation, candidate emergence, and voting behavior. Broadly, this volume addresses the causes and consequences of women’s underrepresentation in American government. This book is the ideal resource for students and researchers of all levels interested in understanding the unique political experiences of diverse women, and the importance of rectifying the problem of gender disparities in American politics.},

These results suggest that the attitudes of White men in the U.S. are anomalous, perhaps because of their historically privileged position regarding risk and power in society.},

System justification impedes efforts to address societal challenges, and in particular gives rise to denial, resistance, and inaction in the face of climate change and environmental problems. Women chronically engage in less system justification than men, and this difference partially explains women’s greater willingness to acknowledge ecological problems and risks and to engage in actions that are beneficial for the environment. We demonstrate that reframing environmental messages as consistent with upholding the established way of life and the well-being of our society gives rise to increased support for environmental efforts on the part of those who are especially motivated to justify the system and can therefore help to narrow the ideological gap in environmental attitudes and behaviors.},

Our purpose here is to conduct a broad overview of the place of gender in environmental sociology. We review gender-relevant scholarship within environmental sociology and argue that to date, critical gender theorizing in the sub-discipline is relatively undeveloped, as evidenced by theory that examines gender without considering power relations. We argue that this represents a shortcoming that should be addressed by future scholarship. In order to inform future critical gender?environment theorizing, we provide a brief review of ecofeminism and note promising examples of scholarship that takes power and inequality seriously when accounting for phenomena of relevance to women and the environment. It is likely that theorizing at the intersection of gender and the environment will become more prevalent given a growing consensus that social justice and equity are precursors to ecological sustainability; environmental sociologists could be the vanguard of critical gender?environment theory.},

Although gender gaps exist in other aspects of political behavior, the unusual magnitude of the gender gap makes it particularly perplexing. In this paper, we advance and test the hypothesis that the knowledge gap is partly an artifact of how knowledge is measured. If men are disproportionately more likely to guess than are women, then observed gender disparities in knowledge will be artificially inflated. To test this hypothesis, we reexamine data used in two recent inquiries concerning the gender gap in knowledge, along with experimental data from the 1998 NES Pilot Study. All analyses point to a common conclusion: approximately 50\% of the gender gap is illusory, reflecting response patterns that work to the collective advantage of male respondents.},

Though studies argue it influences how communities are represented through constituency service, they are limited since legislators' service activities are unobserved. Using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, we collected 88,000 records of communication between members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies during the 108th–113th Congresses. These legislative interventions allow us to examine members' “follow-through” with policy implementation. We find that women, racial/ethnic minorities, and veterans are more likely to work on behalf of constituents with whom they share identities. Including veterans offers leverage in understanding the role of political cleavages and shared experiences. Our findings suggest that shared experiences operate as a critical mechanism for representation, that a lack of political consensus is not necessary for substantive representation, and that the causal relationships identified by experimental work have observable implications in the daily work of Congress.},

Swers persuasively demonstrates that, even though representatives often vote a party line, their gender is politically significant and does indeed influence policy making.  Swers combines quantitative analyses of bills with interviews with legislators and their staff to compare legislative activity on women's issues by male and female members of the House of Representatives during the 103rd (1993-94) and 104th (1995-96) Congresses. Tracking representatives' commitment to women's issues throughout the legislative process, from the introduction of bills through committee consideration to final floor votes, Swers examines how the prevailing political context and members' positions within Congress affect whether and how aggressively they pursue women's issues.  Anyone studying congressional behavior, the role of women, or the representation of social identities in Congress will benefit from Swers's balanced and nuanced analysis.},

Having examined voting behavior from 1981 to 1992, we confirm that female legislators have voting patterns that are more liberal, yet not significantly different, from those of their male counterparts. When regression is applied, gender remains insignificant in explaining voting behavior until 1991 and 1992, where it demonstrates a significant negative effect. Bill introduction data for the same period reveals that congressional women are introducing women-related legislation proportionate to their number. Finally, examining the cohesion of voting patterns reveals that congressional women are as cohesive as or more cohesive than two ethnic congressional groups but less cohesive than southern Democrats or their male partisan counterparts. In combination, the findings suggest that congressional women display distinctive legislative behavior that portends a greater representation of women and women's issues.},

	abstract = {When developping multi-agent systems (MAS) or models in the context of agent-based simulation (ABS), the tuning of the model constitutes a crucial step of the design process. Indeed, agent-based models are generally characterized by lots of parameters, which together determine the global dynamics of the system. Moreover, small changes made to a single parameter sometimes lead to a radical modification of the dynamics of the whole system. The development and the parameter setting of an agent-based model can thus become long and tedious if we have no accurate, automatic and systematic strategy to explore this parameter space.That’s the development of such a strategy that we work on suggesting the use of genetic algorithms. The idea is to capture in the fitness function the goal of the design process (efficiency for MAS that realize a given function, realism for agent-based models, etc.) and to make the model automatically evolve in that direction. However the use of genetic algorithms (GA) in the context of ABS raises specific difficulties that we develop in this article, explaining possible solutions and illustrating them on a simple and well-known model: the food-foraging by a colony of ants.},

This paper explicitly tackles parameter space exploration and calibration of ABMs combining supervised machine-learning and intelligent sampling to build a surrogate meta-model. The proposed approach provides a fast and accurate approximation of model behaviour, dramatically reducing computation time. In that, our machine-learning surrogate facilitates large scale explorations of the parameter-space, while providing a powerful filter to gain insights into the complex functioning of agent-based models. The algorithm introduced in this paper merges model simulation and output analysis into a surrogate meta-model, which substantially ease ABM calibration. We successfully apply our approach to the Brock and Hommes (1998) asset pricing model and to the " Island " endogenous growth model (Fagiolo and Dosi, 2003). Performance is evaluated against a relatively large out-of-sample set of parameter combinations, while employing different user-defined statistical tests for output analysis. The results demonstrate the capacity of machine learning surrogates to facilitate fast and precise exploration of agent-based models' behaviour over their often rugged parameter spaces.},

	abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) have been widely used to study socioecological systems. They are useful for studying such systems because of their ability to incorporate micro-level behaviors among interacting agents, and to understand emergent phenomena due to these interactions. However, ABMs are inherently stochastic and require proper handling of uncertainty. We propose a simulation framework based on quantitative uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to build parsimonious ABMs that serve two purposes: exploration of the outcome space to simulate low-probability but high-consequence events that may have significant policy implications, and explanation of model behavior to describe the system with higher accuracy. The proposed framework is applied to the problem of modeling farmland conservation resulting in land use change. We employ output variance decomposition based on quasi-random sampling of the input space and perform three computational experiments. First, we perform uncertainty analysis to improve model legitimacy, where the distribution of results informs us about the expected value that can be validated against independent data, and provides information on the variance around this mean as well as the extreme results. In our last two computational experiments, we employ sensitivity analysis to produce two simpler versions of the ABM. First, input space is reduced only to inputs that produced the variance of the initial ABM, resulting in a model with output distribution similar to the initial model. Second, we refine the value of the most influential input, producing a model that maintains the mean of the output of initial ABM but with less spread. These simplifications can be used to 1) efficiently explore model outcomes, including outliers that may be important considerations in the design of robust policies, and 2) conduct explanatory analysis that exposes the smallest number of inputs influencing the steady state of the modeled system.},

For our illustrations we use a simple dynamic agent-based model describing the propagation of information between individuals interacting under mimesis in a social network with private and public information. We describe the rules governing the evolution of the agents emotional state dynamics and discover, through simulation, multiple stable stationary states as a function of the network topology.

ABMS promises to have far reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision making and researchers use electronic laboratories to support their research. Some have gone so far as to contend that ABMS is a third way of doing science besides deductive and inductive reasoning. Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications in a variety of fields. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of biowarfare, from modeling consumer behavior to understanding the fall of ancient civilizations, to name a few. This tutorial describes the theoretical and practical foundations of ABMS, identifies toolkits and methods for developing ABMS models, and provides some thoughts on the relationship between ABMS and traditional modeling techniques.},

But the percentage of citizens willing to support a woman presidential party nominee has significantly decreased over the last two years. Based on the results of a Knowledge Networks national random sample survey, this article offers the first empirical examination of the manner in which the atmosphere of war might affect women candidates' electoral prospects. I find that citizens prefer men's leadership traits and characteristics, deem men more competent at legislating around issues of national security and military crises, and contend that men are superior to women at addressing the new obstacles generated by the events of September 11, 2001. As a result of this gender stereotyping, levels of willingness to support a qualified woman presidential candidate are lower than they have been for decades. These findings carry broad implications for the study of women and politics. If women fare as well as men when the political climate is dominated by issues that play to women's stereotypical strengths, but are disadvantaged when "men's issues" dominate the political agenda, then we must reconsider the conclusion that winning elections has nothing to do with the sex of the candidate.},

These strategic choices are particularly important because of women's underrepresentation in American politics. Employing an experimental design, I found that male and female candidates who used gender-bending rhetoric were able to overturn stereotypes by persuading and priming voters. Male candidates were particularly successful. This was contrary to prior findings that consistency—at least in terms of party—is a superior strategy.

Strong support was found for the outgroup effect, as party chairs consistently preferred candidates more like themselves.

Sex stereotypes, on the other hand, can advantage female candidates. Female candidates are viewed as more compassionate and more honest than identical male candidates.

This important and practical book addresses such critical questions as: How far have women actually come as leaders? Do stereotypes and prejudices still limit women's opportunities? Do people resist women's leadership more than men's? And, do organisations create obstacles to women who would be leaders?This book's rich analysis is founded on scientific research from psychology, economics, sociology, political science, and management. The authors ground their conclusions in that research and invoke a wealth of engaging anecdotes and personal accounts to illustrate the practical principles that emerge. With excellent leadership in short supply, no group, organisation, or nation can afford to restrict women's access to leadership roles. This book evaluates whether such restrictions are present and, when they are, what we can do to eliminate them.},

Highly qualified and politically well-connected women from both major political parties are less likely than similarly situated men to be recruited to run for public office by all types of political actors. They are less likely than men to be recruited intensely. And they are less likely than men to be recruited by multiple sources. Although we paint a picture of a political recruitment process that seems to suppress women’s inclusion, we also offer the first evidence of the significant headway women’s organizations are making in their efforts to mitigate the recruitment gap, especially among Democrats.

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling is commonly used for studying complex system properties emergent from interactions among agents. However, agent-based models are often not developed explicitly for prediction, and are generally not validated as such. We therefore present a novel data-driven agent-based modeling framework, in which individual behavior model is learned by machine learning techniques, deployed in multi-agent systems and validated using a holdout sequence of collective adoption decisions. We apply the framework to forecasting individual and aggregate residential rooftop solar adoption in San Diego county and demonstrate that the resulting agent-based model successfully forecasts solar adoption trends and provides a meaningful quantification of uncertainty about its predictions. Meanwhile, we construct a second agent-based model, with its parameters calibrated based on mean square error of its fitted aggregate adoption to the ground truth. Our result suggests that our data-driven agent-based approach based on maximum likelihood estimation substantially outperforms the calibrated agent-based model. Seeing advantage over the state-of-the-art modeling methodology, we utilize our agent-based model to aid search for potentially better incentive structures aimed at spurring more solar adoption. Although the impact of solar subsidies is rather limited in our case, our study still reveals that a simple heuristic search algorithm can lead to more effective incentive plans than the current solar subsidies in San Diego County and a previously explored structure. Finally, we examine an exclusive class of policies that gives away free systems to low-income households, which are shown significantly more efficacious than any incentive-based policies we have analyzed to date.},

	abstract = {Customer retention is a critical concern for mobile network operators because of the increasing competition in the mobile services sector. Such unease has driven companies to exploit data as an avenue to better understand changing customer behavior. Data-mining techniques such as clustering and classification have been widely adopted in the mobile services sector to better understand customer retention. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is debatable due to the constant change and increasing complexity of the mobile market itself. This design study proposes an application of agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) as a novel approach to understanding customer behavior through the combination of market and social factors that emerge from data. External forces at play and possible company interventions can then be added to data-derived models. A dataset provided by a mobile network operator is utilized to automate decision-tree analysis and subsequent building of agent-based models. Popular churn modeling techniques were adopted in order to automate the development of models, from decision trees, and subsequently explore possible customer churn scenarios. ABMS is used to understand the behavior of customers and detect reasons why customers churned or stayed with their respective mobile network operators. A CART decision-tree method is presented that identifies agents, selects important attributes, and uncovers customer behavior – easily identifying tenure, location, and choice of mobile devices as determinants for the churn-or-stay decision. Word of mouth between customers is also explored as a possible influence factor. Importantly, methods for automating data-driven agent-based simulation model generation will support faster exploration and experimentation – including with those determinants from a wider market or social context.},

Despite this opportunity, the literature has neglected to offer a structured agent-based modeling approach to produce agents or its parts directly from data. In this paper, we present initial steps towards an agent-based modeling approach that focuses on individual-level data to generate agent behavioral rules and initialize agent attribute values. We present a structured way to integrate Big Data and machine learning techniques at the individual agent-level. We also describe a conceptual use-case study of an urban mobility simulation driven by millions of geo-tagged Twitter social media messages. We believe our approach will advance the-state-of-the-art in developing empirical ABMs and conducting their validation. Further work is needed to assess data suitability, to compare with other approaches, to standardize data collection, and to serve all these features in near-real time.},

	abstract = {Socio-Ecological Systems (SESs) are the systems in which our everyday lives are embedded, so understanding them is important. The complex properties of such systems make modelling an indispensable tool for their description and analysis. Human actors play a pivotal role in SESs, but their interactions with each other and their environment are often underrepresented in SES modelling. We argue that more attention should be given to social aspects in models of SESs, but this entails additional kinds of complexity. Modelling choices need to be as transparent as possible, and to be based on analysis of the purposes and limitations of modelling. We recommend thinking in terms of modelling projects rather than single models. Such a project may involve multiple models adopting different modelling methods. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are an essential tool in an SES modelling project, but their expressivity, which is their major advantage, also produces problems with model transparency and validation. We propose the use of formal ontologies to make the structure and meaning of models as explicit as possible, facilitating model design, implementation, assessment, comparison and extension.},

Its use is partially driven by increasing demand from decision makers to provide support for understanding the potential implications of decisions in complex situations. While one of the advantages of agent-based modelling is the ability to simulate the implications of human decision-making processes explicitly, methods for providing empirical support for the representation of the behaviour of human agents have not been structured systematically. This paper develops a framework for the parameterisation of human behaviour in agent-based models and develops twelve distinct sequences for the characterisation and parameterisation of human behaviours. Examples are provided to illustrate the most important sequences. This framework is a first step towards a guide for parameterisation of human behaviour in ABM. A structured discussion within the agent-based community is needed to achieve a more definitive guideline.},

	abstract = {There has been a decrease in grazing mobility in the Mongolian grasslands over the past decades. Sedentary grazing with substantial external inputs has increased the cost of livestock production. As a result, the livelihoods of herders have become more vulnerable to climate variability and change. Sedentary grazing is the formal institutional arrangement in Inner Mongolia, China. However, this may not be an efficient institutional arrangement for climate change adaptation. Self-organized local institutions for climate change adaptation have emerged and are under development in the study area. In this study, we did exploratory analyses of multiple local institutions for climate change adaptation in the Mongolian grasslands, using an agent-based modeling approach. Empirical studies from literature and our field work show that sedentary grazing, pasture rental markets, and reciprocal pasture-use groups are three popular institutional arrangements in the study area. First, we modeled the social–ecological performance (i.e., livelihood benefits to herders and grassland quality) of these institutions and their combinations under different climate conditions. Second, we did exploratory analyses of multiple social mechanisms for facilitating and maintaining cooperative use of pastures among herders. The modeling results show that in certain value-ranges of some model parameters with assumed values, reciprocal pasture-use groups had better performance than pasture rental markets; and the comparative advantage of cooperative use of pastures over sedentary grazing without cooperation becomes more evident with the increase in drought probability. Agent diversity and social norms were effective for facilitating the development of reciprocal pasture-use groups. Kin selection and punishments on free-riders were useful for maintaining cooperation among herders.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number of modeling tools available to examine future land-use and land-cover (LULC) change. Integrated modeling frameworks, agent-based models, cellular automata approaches, and other modeling techniques have substantially improved the representation of complex LULC systems, with each method using a different strategy to address complexity. However, despite the development of new and better modeling tools, the use of these tools is limited for actual planning, decision-making, or policy-making purposes. LULC modelers have become very adept at creating tools for modeling LULC change, but complicated models and lack of transparency limit their utility for decision-makers. The complicated nature of many LULC models also makes it impractical or even impossible to perform a rigorous analysis of modeling uncertainty. This paper provides a review of land-cover modeling approaches and the issues causes by the complicated nature of models, and provides suggestions to facilitate the increased use of LULC models by decision-makers and other stakeholders. The utility of LULC models themselves can be improved by 1) providing model code and documentation, 2) through the use of scenario frameworks to frame overall uncertainties, 3) improving methods for generalizing key LULC processes most important to stakeholders, and 4) adopting more rigorous standards for validating models and quantifying uncertainty. Communication with decision-makers and other stakeholders can be improved by increasing stakeholder participation in all stages of the modeling process, increasing the transparency of model structure and uncertainties, and developing user-friendly decision-support systems to bridge the link between LULC science and policy. By considering these options, LULC science will be better positioned to support decision-makers and increase real-world application of LULC modeling results.},

	abstract = {In Vietnam, the remarkable economic growth that resulted from the doi moi (renovation) reforms was based largely on the rural households that had become the new basic unit of agricultural production in the early 1990s. The technical, economic, and social changes that accompanied the decollectivization process transformed agricultural production, resource management, land use, and the institutions that defined access to resources and their distribution. Combined with the extreme biophysical, technical, and social heterogeneity encountered in the northern mountains, these rapid changes led to the extreme complexity of the agrarian dynamics that today challenges traditional diagnostic approaches. Since 1999, a participatory simulation method has been developed to disentangle the cause-and-effect relationships between the different driving forces and changes in land use observed at different scales. Several tools were combined to understand the interactions between human and natural systems, including a narrative conceptual model, an agent-based spatial computational model (ABM), a role-playing game, and a multiscale geographic information system (GIS). We synthesized into an ABM named SAMBA-GIS the knowledge generated from the above tools applied to a representative sample of research sites. The model takes explicitly into account the dynamic interactions among: (1) farmers¿ strategies, i.e., the individual decision-making process as a function of the farm¿s resource profile; (2) the institutions that define resource access and usage; and (3) changes in the biophysical and socioeconomic environment. The next step consisted of coupling the ABM with the GIS to extrapolate the application of local management rules to a whole landscape. Simulations are initialized using the layers of the GIS, e.g., land use in 1990, accessibility, soil characteristics, etc., and statistics available at the village level, e.g., population, ethnicity, livestock, etc. At each annual time step, the agrarian landscape changes according to the decisions made by agent-farmers about how to allocate resources such as labor force, capital, and land to different productive activities, e.g., crops, livestock, gathering of forest products, off-farm activities. The participatory simulations based on SAMBA-GIS helped identify villages with similar land-use change trajectories to which the same types of technical and/or institutional innovations could be applied. Scenarios of land-use changes were developed with local stakeholders to assess the potential impact of these changes on the natural resource base and on agricultural development. This adaptive approach was gradually refined through interactions between researchers and the local population.},

Planning professionals use computer models to simulate the interaction effects of different planrelated policies, but most are "black boxes" to stakeholders, who, therefore, are forced to trust the simulations without understanding human-environmental complexity, reducing the opportunities for effective solution building. Agent-based models can represent decisions and environmental dynamics in a rule-based form that invites nonexpert users' involvement in both developing the model and meaningfully interpreting its outputs. We conducted a series of collaborative and developmental agent-based modeling meetings with stakeholders and planners in a rapidly suburbanizing area facing groundwater shortages. Stakeholders learned how to use the models, understand the relationships among the components, interpret the outputs based on these relationships, and suggested modifications with new insights. The enhanced understanding of complex interactions reduced early commitments to policy solutions as stakeholders jointly explored the range of possible outcomes. These results show that agent-based modeling holds promise for use in collaborative planning exercises.},

	abstract = {Confusion about model validation is one of the main challenges in using ecological models for decision support, such as the regulation of pesticides. Decision makers need to know whether a model is a sufficiently good representation of its real counterpart and what criteria can be used to answer this question. Unclear terminology is one of the main obstacles to a good understanding of what model validation is, how it works, and what it can deliver. Therefore, we performed a literature review and derived a standard set of terms. ‘Validation’ was identified as a catch-all term, which is thus useless for any practical purpose. We introduce the term ‘evaludation’, a fusion of ‘evaluation’ and ‘validation’, to describe the entire process of assessing a model's quality and reliability. Considering the iterative nature of model development, the modelling cycle, we identified six essential elements of evaludation: (i) ‘data evaluation’ for scrutinising the quality of numerical and qualitative data used for model development and testing; (ii) ‘conceptual model evaluation’ for examining the simplifying assumptions underlying a model's design; (iii) ‘implementation verification’ for testing the model's implementation in equations and as a computer programme; (iv) ‘model output verification’ for comparing model output to data and patterns that guided model design and were possibly used for calibration; (v) ‘model analysis’ for exploring the model's sensitivity to changes in parameters and process formulations to make sure that the mechanistic basis of main behaviours of the model has been well understood; and (vi) ‘model output corroboration’ for comparing model output to new data and patterns that were not used for model development and parameterisation. Currently, most decision makers require ‘validating’ a model by testing its predictions with new experiments or data. Despite being desirable, this is neither sufficient nor necessary for a model to be useful for decision support. We believe that the proposed set of terms and its relation to the modelling cycle can help to make quality assessments and reality checks of ecological models more comprehensive and transparent.},

We argue that this behavioral difference does not serve women equally well in all institutional settings. Contentious and partisan activities of male lawmakers may help them outperform women when in a polarized majority party. However, in the minority party, while men may choose to obstruct and delay, women continue to strive to build coalitions and bring about new policies. We find strong evidence that minority party women in the U.S. House of Representatives are better able to keep their sponsored bills alive through later stages of the legislative process than are minority party men, across the 93rd–110th Congresses (1973–2008). The opposite is true for majority party women, however, who counterbalance this lack of later success by introducing more legislation. Moreover, while the legislative style of minority party women has served them well consistently across the past four decades, majority party women have become less effective as Congress has become more polarized.},

The problem with this popularly held view is that it is entirely anecdotal. In assembling several new data sets to test this proposition systematically, we find that women are more likely than men to participate in the kinds of activities that foster collegiality. But we uncover almost no evidence that women’s legislative behavior on fact finding abroad, cosponsoring legislation, or engaging the legislative process differs from men’s. The partisan divide that now characterizes the legislative process creates strong disincentives for women (and men) to engage in bipartisan problem solving. To be sure, women’s presence in Congress promotes democratic legitimacy, but it does little to reduce gridlock and stalemate on Capitol Hill.},

We employ a number of econometric methodologies to address the potential selection of female representatives into electoral districts with distinct preferences for cooperativeness, including regression discontinuity and matching. After accounting for selection, we find that among Democrats there is no significant gender gap in the number of cosponsors recruited, but women-sponsored bills tend to have fewer cosponsors from the opposite party. On the other hand, we find robust evidence that Republican women recruit more cosponsors and attract more bipartisan support on the bills that they sponsor. This is particularly true on bills that address issues more relevant for women, over which female Republicans have possibly preferences that are closer to those of Democrats. We interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest, rather than gender per se.},

Our analysis reveals that most (but not all) of the classically considered women’s issues are indeed raised at an enhanced rate by congresswomen. We then track the fate of those issues. While 4 percent of all bills become law, that rate drops to 2 percent for women’s issues and to only 1 percent for women’s issue bills sponsored by women themselves. This pattern persists over time—from the early 1970s through today—and upon controlling for other factors that influence bills success rates.

At the same time, Congress is more polarized than ever, and little research exists on how women in Congress view their experiences and contributions to American politics today. Drawing on personal interviews with over three-quarters of the women serving in the 114th Congress (2015-17), the authors analyze how these women navigate today's stark partisan divisions, and whether they feel effective in their jobs. Through first-person perspectives, A Seat at the Table looks at what motivates these women's legislative priorities and behavior, details the ways in which women experience service within a male-dominated institution, and highlights why it matters that women sit in the nation's federal legislative chambers. It describes the strategies women employ to overcome any challenges they confront as well as the opportunities available to them. The book examines how gender interacts with political party, race and ethnicity, seniority, chamber, and district characteristics to shape women's representational influence and behavior, finding that party and race/ethnicity are the two most complicating factors to a singular narrative of women's congressional representation. While congresswomen's perspectives, experiences, and influence are neither uniform nor interchangeable, they strongly believe their presence matters in myriad ways, affecting congressional culture, priorities, processes, debates, and outcomes.},

Having examined voting behavior from 1981 to 1992, we confirm that female legislators have voting patterns that are more liberal, yet not significantly different, from those of their male counterparts. When regression is applied, gender remains insignificant in explaining voting behavior until 1991 and 1992, where it demonstrates a significant negative effect. Bill introduction data for the same period reveals that congressional women are introducing women-related legislation proportionate to their number. Finally, examining the cohesion of voting patterns reveals that congressional women are as cohesive as or more cohesive than two ethnic congressional groups but less cohesive than southern Democrats or their male partisan counterparts. In combination, the findings suggest that congressional women display distinctive legislative behavior that portends a greater representation of women and women's issues.},

Stylized facts are both positive claims (about what is in the world) and normative claims (about what merits scholarly attention). Much of canonical social science research can be usefully characterized as the production or contestation of stylized facts. Beyond their value as grist for the theoretical mill of social scientists, stylized facts also travel directly into the political arena. Drawing on three recent examples, I show how stylized facts can interact with existing folk causal theories to reconstitute political debates and how tensions in the operationalization of folk concepts drive contention around stylized fact claims.},

The article offers a three-point argument to approach this question. First, people and environment need to be considered together, as social (human) and ecological (biophysical) subsystems are linked by mutual feedbacks, and are interdependent and co-evolutionary. These integrated systems of humans and environment (social-ecological systems) provide an appropriate unit of analysis. Second, the resilience approach deals with change in multilevel complex systems, and has stimulated much of the adaptive governance literature by addressing uncertainty and adaptation to unforeseen future changes. Third, there is a need to foster collaborative approaches to improve social and institutional learning, as for example in adaptive management, collaborative learning networks, and knowledge co-production. Collaborative learning is perhaps where further research, experimentation, and application might make a difference for operationalizing adaptive governance, with a focus on institutions, at all levels from local to international.},

Since the work of Maynard Smith and others, it has been realized how game theory can model this process. Evolutionary game theory replaces the static solutions of classical game theory by a dynamical approach centered not on the concept of rational players but on the population dynamics of behavioral programs. In this book the authors investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the self-regulation of social and economic behavior, and of the closely related interactions among species in ecological communities. Replicator equations describe how successful strategies spread and thereby create new conditions that can alter the basis of their success, i.e., to enable us to understand the strategic and genetic foundations of the endless chronicle of invasions and extinctions that punctuate evolution. In short, evolutionary game theory describes when to escalate a conflict, how to elicit cooperation, why to expect a balance of the sexes, and how to understand natural selection in mathematical terms.},

Agent-based modelling is a way to model the dynamics of complex systems and complex adaptive systems. Such systems often self-organize themselves and create emergent order. Agent-based models also include models of behaviour (human or otherwise) and are used to observe the collective effects of agent behaviours and interactions. The development of agent modelling tools, the availability of micro-data, and advances in computation have made possible a growing number of agent-based applications across a variety of domains and disciplines. This article provides a brief introduction to ABMS, illustrates the main concepts and foundations, discusses some recent applications across a variety of disciplines, and identifies methods and toolkits for developing agent models.},

Food insecurity, financial assets drained of value by environmental damage, and a rapid rise in diseases of animal origin are among the underreported consequences of an unsustainable global system. In State of the World 2015, the flagship publication of The Worldwatch Institute, experts explore hidden threats to sustainability and how to address them. How will nations deal with migration as climate change refugees cross borders in order to escape flooding, drought, or other extreme weather events? What will happen to the price and availability of fossil energy—the foundation of industrial civilization--as these resources oscillate between surplus and scarcity? If perpetual economic growth on a finite planet is impossible, what are the alternatives? Can national governments manage the transition? Eight key issues are addressed in depth, along with the central question of how we can develop resilience to these and other shocks. For decades, The Worldwatch Institute has been a leader in identifying and analyzing emerging environmental threats. With the latest edition of State of The World, the authorities at Worldwatch bring to light challenges we can no longer afford to ignore.},

	abstract = {Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) has been on the ascendancy for several decades and plays a leading role in conservation strategies worldwide. Arriving out of a desire to rectify the human costs associated with coercive conservation, CBNRM sought to return the stewardship of biodiversity and natural resources to local communities through participation, empowerment and decentralization. Today, however, scholars and practitioners suggest that CBNRM is experiencing a crisis of identity and purpose, with even the most positive examples experiencing only fleeting success due to major deficiencies. Six case studies from around the world offer a history of how and why the global CBNRM narrative has unfolded over time and space. While CBNRM emerged with promise and hope, it often ended in less than ideal outcomes when institutionalized and reconfigured in design and practice. Nevertheless, despite the current crisis, there is scope for refocusing on the original ideals of CBNRM: ensuring social justice, material well-being and environmental integrity.},

	abstract = {Natural resource management has changed profoundly in recent decades emphasizing new legislation that transfers responsibilities to local user groups. In this article, I follow changing water policies to Namibia and show that the enactment of policy in local institutions deviates from community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) blueprints and design. To understand why, I examine the theoretical premises of CBNRM. CBNRM is informed by rational choice theory which isolates economic transactions (e.g., sharing water) and assumes that people design institutions for a specific good. However, in the communities I study ethnographically, people depend on sharing multiple resources. To better understand how the degree of sharing and institutional overlaps matter, I explore empirically the concept of institutional multiplexity. Institutional multiplexity describes the number of transactions between two households in a social network. The results reveal that almost all social networks are institutionally multiplex. Institutional multiplexity implies that people cannot separate the sharing of water from sharing in other domains. Institutional multiplexity hinders the implementation of design principles such as fixing boundaries, sharing costs proportional to use, and formal sanctioning. However, it also opens other means for governing nature through social control.},
